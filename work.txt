Loading Web Components v1 polyfills

Web Components

<p>Web Components v1 is a revision of the earlier Web Components specification, now labelled v0. The latter saw little traction in the web developer community. Although many were interested in the approach, browser vendors demurred on key parts such HTML imports, and the initial enthusiasm receded.</p>

<p>Web Components v1 is far from being a finished spec, being mostly in draft status. Wikipedia describes the W3C working draft status as follows:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium#Working_draft_.28WD.29">
<p>After enough content has been gathered from ‘editor drafts’ and discussion, it may be published as a working draft (WD) for review by the community. A WD document is the first form of a standard that is publicly available. Commentary by virtually anyone is accepted, though no promises are made with regard to action on any particular element commented upon.</p>

<p>At this stage, the standard document may have significant differences from its final form. As such, anyone who implements WD standards should be ready to significantly modify their implementations as the standard matures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Polymer team has been working on polyfills for v1, which will be finalised in tandem with the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/about_20" rel="external" class="underline">Polymer 2.0</a> release <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/2016-12-21-polymer-2.0-update" rel="external" class="underline">later in the year</a>.</p>

<p>These can be found on the v1 branch of the webcomponents.js <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/tree/v1" rel="external" class="underline">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h3>A polyfill, not a compiler</h3>

<p>When writing ES6, most developers use a compiler to transform the code into ES5 or even ES3 JavaScript, which allows the code to work in the widest spectrum of browsers.</p>

<p>One part of ES6, officially entitled ‘ECMA-262 6th Edition, The ECMAScript 2015 Language Specification’, allows the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array-constructor" rel="external" class="underline">subclassing of arrays</a>, <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-regexp-constructor" rel="external" class="underline">RegExp</a>, <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-function-constructor" rel="external" class="underline">functions</a> and <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-promise-constructor" rel="external" class="underline">promise constructors</a>.</p>

<p>This is an example of subclassing builtins:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
class VersionedArray extends Array {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.history = [
            []
        ];
    }
    commit() {
        this.history.push(this.slice());
    }
    revert() {
        this.splice(0, this.length, this.history[this.history.length - 1]);
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The much-loved <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/" rel="external" class="underline">Kangex ECMAScript 6 compatibility table</a> details zero support for ES6 subclassing in Babel.</p>

<p>Worse than that, subclassing builtin elements will likely <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/4480" rel="external" class="underline">create bugs</a> if transpiling with Babel, which is why, if you need to extend native components, I would recommend investigating <a href="https://twitter.com/WebReflection" rel="external" class="underline">Andrea Giammarchi’s</a> plugin, <a href="https://github.com/WebReflection/classtrophobic" rel="external" class="underline">classtrophobic</a>.</p>

<p>The reason Babel doesn’t support transpiling is due to the complexities in implementation, which mean that it <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/33877501/315350" rel="external" class="underline">can’t be fully ported for use in older browsers</a>.</p>

<h3>Conditionally loading polyfills</h3>

<p>There are two sets of competent polyfills. The first of these, <a href="https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element" rel="external" class="underline">document-register-element</a>, is for custom elements only; the other is <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/tree/v1" rel="external" class="underline">webcomponents.js</a>, which is, at the time of writing, in release candidate status for Web Components v1 support. The latter is a suite of polyfills that come bundled together as one file, if one so desires.</p>

<p>Best practice is to conditionally load the polyfills using feature detection.</p>

<p><a href="https://modernizr.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Modernizr</a> has support for HTML imports and HTML templates, and it is easy to add a feature detection test for the Shadow DOM and Custom Elements:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
Modernizr.addTest('domshadow', function() {
    return !!document.head.attachShadow;
});

Modernizr.addTest('customelements', function() {
    return !!window.customElements;
});
</code>
</pre>

<p>For optimal performance load, the scripts conditionally use promises:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
/**
 * @param src {string}
 * @returns {Promise}
 */
function loadScript(src) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        const script = document.createElement('script');
        script.async = true;
        script.rel = 'preload';
        script.src = src;
        script.onload = resolve;
        script.onerror = reject;
        document.head.appendChild(script);
    });
}

// Lazy load the polyfill if necessary.
if (!Modernizr.domshadow) {
    loadScript('path/to/polyfill/shadydom.js')
        .then(e => loadScript('path/to/polyfill/shadycss.js'))
        .then(() => {
            return true;
        });
}

if (!Modernizr.htmlimports) {
    loadScript('path/to/polyfill/html_imports.js')
        .then(() => {
            return true;
        });
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you use the webcomponents-lite.js file it comes with its own <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/blob/v1/webcomponents-loader.js" rel="external" class="underline">conditional loader</a>:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
(function() {
    // Feature detect which polyfill needs to be imported.
    let polyfills = [];
    if (!('import' in document.createElement('link'))) {
        polyfills.push('hi');
    }
    if (!('attachShadow' in Element.prototype && 'getRootNode' in Element.prototype) ||
        (window.ShadyDOM && window.ShadyDOM.force)) {
        polyfills.push('sd');
    }
    if (!window.customElements || window.customElements.forcePolyfill) {
        polyfills.push('ce');
    }
    if (!('content' in document.createElement('template')) || !window.Promise ||
        // Edge has broken fragment cloning which means you cannot clone template.content
        !(document.createDocumentFragment().cloneNode() instanceof DocumentFragment)) {
        polyfills.push('pf');
    }

    if (polyfills.length === 4) { // hi-ce-sd-pf is actually called lite.
        polyfills = ['lite'];
    }

    if (polyfills.length) {
        var script = document.querySelector('script[src*="webcomponents-loader.js"]');
        let newScript = document.createElement('script');
        // Load it from the right place.
        var url = script.src.replace(
            'webcomponents-loader.js', `webcomponents-${polyfills.join('-')}.js`);
        newScript.src = url;
        document.head.appendChild(newScript);
    } else {
        // Ensure `WebComponentsReady` is fired also when there are no polyfills loaded.
        requestAnimationFrame(function() {
            window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('WebComponentsReady'));
        });
    }
})();
</code>
</pre>

The mediator pattern refactored in ES6

JavaScript

<p>I wrote a Todo app for my <a href="https://andywalpole.me/category/web%20components" rel="external" class="underline">current series of blog posts on Web Components</a>. For the data flow I used the mediator pattern, with custom events channelling the data out of the components and attributes channelling it in.</p>

<p>Addy Osmani published the influential <a href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/" rel="external" class="underline">Learning JavaScript Design Patterns</a>, but it’s from his <a href="https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/" rel="external" class="underline">Patterns For Large-Scale JavaScript Application Architecture</a> that I took the following code:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
// es5: https://gist.github.com/addyosmani/1837327
var mediator = (function() {
    // Subscribe to an event, supply a callback to be executed
    // when that event is broadcast
    var subscribe = function(channel, fn) {
            if (!mediator.channels[channel]) mediator.channels[channel] = [];
            mediator.channels[channel].push({
                context: this,
                callback: fn
            });
            return this;
        },

        // Publish/broadcast an event to the rest of the application
        publish = function(channel) {
            if (!mediator.channels[channel]) return false;
            var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);
            for (var i = 0, l = mediator.channels[channel].length; i < l; i++) {
                var subscription = mediator.channels[channel][i];
                subscription.callback.apply(subscription.context, args);
            }
            return this;
        };

    return {
        channels: {},
        publish: publish,
        subscribe: subscribe,
        installTo: function(obj) {
            obj.subscribe = subscribe;
            obj.publish = publish;
        }
    };

}());
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is used as per the example in the document linked to previously:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
//Pub/sub on a centralized mediator
mediator.name = "tim";
mediator.subscribe('nameChange', function(arg) {
    console.log(this.name);
    this.name = arg;
    console.log(this.name);
});

mediator.publish('nameChange', 'david'); //tim, david

//Pub/sub via third party mediator

var obj = {
    name: 'sam'
};
mediator.installTo(obj);
obj.subscribe('nameChange', function(arg) {
    console.log(this.name);
    this.name = arg;
    console.log(this.name);
});

obj.publish('nameChange', 'john'); //sam, john
</code>
</pre>

<h3>ES6/ES2015 mediator pattern</h3>

<p>This is how I changed the code to a modern idiom.</p>

<p>Firstly, I used const instead of var and arrow functions where suitable. I deliberately kept the ‘subscribe’ and ‘publish’ functions so as to avoid polluting the global scope:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
const mediator = ((() => {

    const subscribe = function() {

        return this;
    };

    const publish = function() {

        return this;
    };

    return {
        stores: {},
        publish,
        subscribe,
        installTo: function(obj) {
            obj.subscribe = subscribe;
            obj.publish = publish;
        }
    };
})());
</code>
</pre>

<p>In the publish function, instead of converting an unknown number of arguments using Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1), I used the rest parameters while replacing the verbose for-loop with a for...of loop.</p>

<p>I swapped the term ‘channels’ for ‘stores’, purely for my own semantic understanding.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
const publish = function(store, ...args) {

    if (!mediator.stores[store]) {
        return false;
    }

    for (let value of mediator.stores[store]) {
        const subscription = value;
        subscription.callback.apply(subscription.context, args);
    }

    return this;
};
</code>
</pre>

<p>The final version, with code comments, is below. I created a GitGist page for this, so perhaps you would like to fork it and continue with the ES6 refactoring: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TCotton/d85e879fdbf856ddae3511652f9260f0" rel="external" class="underline">https://gist.github.com/TCotton/d85e879fdbf856ddae3511652f9260f0</a>.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
const mediator = ((() => {

    /**
     * @description Subscribe to an event, supply a callback to be executed when that event is broadcast
     * @param store {string}
     * @param fn {function}
     * @returns {subscribe} {object}
     */
    const subscribe = function(store, fn) {

        if (!mediator.stores[store]) {
            mediator.stores[store] = [];
        }

        mediator.stores[store].push({
            context: this,
            callback: fn
        });

        return this;
    };

    /**
     * @description Publish/broadcast an event to the rest of the application
     * @param store {string}
     * @param args {object}
     * @returns {*||boolean}
     */
    const publish = function(store, ...args) {

        if (!mediator.stores[store]) {
            return false;
        }

        for (let value of mediator.stores[store]) {
            const subscription = value;
            subscription.callback.apply(subscription.context, args);
        }

        return this;
    };

    return {
        stores: {},
        publish,
        subscribe,
        installTo: function(obj) {
            obj.subscribe = subscribe;
            obj.publish = publish;
        }
    };
})());
</code>
</pre>

<p>Finally, as the project progressed, I decided against the above code and used a Map collection for the mediator:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
const toDoData = new Map();
</code>
</pre>

<p>This, surely, has to be the ultimate ES6 mediator pattern refactor!</p>

Comparing Web Components and React, part one: Custom Elements and React lifecycle hooks #usetheplatform

Web Components

<p>A few years ago, Google were the chief evangelists for web component frontend development. The original specification, Web Components v0, has been retired, with its replacement, Web Components v1, being gradually rolled out across all major browsers. Disagreements between the browser vendors left v0 in tatters, with discord fermenting on the issue of HTML Imports, among other things.</p>

<p>The current state of Web Components progress in the W3C standards body is Group Notes status for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-html-templates-20140318/" rel="external" class="underline">HTML Templates</a> and Working Draft status for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-shadow-dom-20170116/" rel="external" class="underline">Shadow DOM</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-custom-elements-20161013/" rel="external" class="underline">Custom Elements</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-html-imports-20160225/" rel="external" class="underline">HTML Imports</a>. </p>

<p>There are still areas of conflict, with node inclusion methods divided between the declarative and imperative approaches. So:</p>

<pre class="language-html">
<code>
<code-editor></code-editor>
</code>
</pre>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre class="language-html">
<code>
<textarea is="code-editor"></textarea>
</code>
</pre>

<p><a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2015/web-components-accessibility-and-the-priority-of-constituencies/" rel="external" class="underline">Bruce Lawson blogged about this disagreement nearly two years ago</a>, and, at the time of writing, it is still unresolved.</p>

<p>After using the nascent Web Components v1, there are three snagging issues I encountered.</p>

<h3>Patchy browser implementation</h3>

<p>The most recent Chrome stable version (v56) has a full implementation of Custom Elements; <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_10_1.html" rel="external" class="underline">Safari has partial support</a>; while it is <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/customelements/" rel="external" class="underline">under consideration by Edge</a>; and is currently being <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=889230" rel="external" class="underline">worked on at Firefox</a>. </p>

<p>The Shadow DOM at Chrome is <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/zrZRD2ls5tw" rel="external" class="underline">under the ‘intend to ship’ status</a>, and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=811542" rel="external" class="underline">in development at Firefox</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/07/15/microsoft-edge-and-web-components/" rel="external" class="underline">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/07/15/microsoft-edge-and-web-components/" rel="external" class="underline">Safari</a>. </p>

<p>The template element has already been shipped by Chrome, Firefox and Safari, with only Edge failing to keep pace.</p>

<p>HTML Imports are the least ready of the four Web Components parts. They have been a feature of Chrome for some time now, and are <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=877072" rel="external" class="underline">in development at Firefox</a>. However, Edge and Safari have shown little or no enthusiasm.</p>

<h3>Buggy polyfills</h3>

<p>I repeatedly hit inconsistencies when using polyfills for non-supporting browsers. Admittedly, as I’m new to Web Components v1, the blame may lie with the workman rather than his tools. I have settled on <a href="https://www.webreflection.co.uk/" rel="external" class="underline">Andrea Giammarchi’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element" rel="external" class="underline">document-register-element</a>, <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/shadydom" rel="external" class="underline">shadydom</a> and <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/shadycss" rel="external" class="underline">shadycss</a>, as provided by the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/about_20" rel="external" class="underline">Polymer team</a>.</p>

<h3>Confusing online documentation</h3>

<p>Most browsers partially executed Web Components v0, and existing online documentation reflects the previous aborted approach. I found v0 code examples on trustworthy sites, and, although it takes relatively little time to discern the difference between the two versions, it is, nevertheless, confusing for beginners.</p>

<h3>React and Custom Element lifecycle hooks</h3>

<p>Through his article "<a href="https://hackernoon.com/web-components-the-react-way-8ed5b6f4f942#.qcervkhl8" rel="external" class="underline">Web Components, the React way</a>", a UI interface designer at Strip, kindled the idea in me of making direct comparisons between the two.
React, in 2017, is quite possibly the most popular JavaScript library. Others, such as jQuery and Underscore, may be more widely used, but React leads the field for creating components on the view layer.</p>

<p>It is an approach that has revolutionised frontend development. For close to 20 years, best practice meant a separation of concerns (SoC) that siloed CSS, HTML and JavaScript. With a component-based architecture, the SoC is organised on the basis of functionality, not technology. In truth, although the old methods meant a folder structure that kept styles, languages and markup apart, they were often unhealthily interlinked through long CSS selector chains or badly named classes.</p>

<p>React hasn’t expressed any interest in integrating Web Components into their library, and, as this year progresses, Web Components will become an attractive choice to use in production. It’s worth spending time now to examine the similarities and differences between the two, so that it is possible to make an informed decision about their appropriate use. </p>

<p>Web Components is not, obviously, a library; it is a native browser implementation with the same ethos as React towards modularised frontend development. Also, because it is part of the web layer rather than sitting on top of it, it brings advantages, like manipulating the layout and presentation of page elements by extending interfaces such as HTMLButtonElement, HTMLSelectElement and HTMLImageElement  (Warning! As of March 2017 this is not possible at the moment).</p>

<p>Lifecycle hooks are used to make style and markup changes in the various stages of a component’s existence, from pre- to post-render and any data changes in between.</p>

<p>React has seven different methods, while Web Components has four. They are presented below with code comments as a means of explanation.</p>

<h3>Web Components lifecycle hooks</h3>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
class CustomElement extends HTMLElement {

  constructor() {
    // super is always called first in the class constructor
    super();
  }

  // When it becomes connected, its connectedCallback is run.
  connectedCallback() { /**/ }

  // When it becomes disconnected, its disconnectedCallback is run.
  disconnectedCallback() { /**/ }

  // When it is adopted into a new document, its adoptedCallback is run.
  adoptedCallback() { /**/ }

  /**
   * @param name {string}
   * @param oldValue {*}
   * @param newValue {*}
   * @returns {null}
   */
  // When any of its attributes are changed, appended, removed, or replaced, its attributeChangedCallback is run.
  attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) { /**/ }

}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>React lifecycle methods</h3>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
class Excluded extends React.Component {

    // use constructor to access this.props in the constructor, if present
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }

    /**
     * @param nextProps {object}
     * @param nextState {object}
     * @returns {boolean}
     */
    // When it is rendered the shouldComponentUpdate is called
    // This is used to prevent any unnecessary re-rendering
    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @param nextProps {object}
     * @param nextState {object}
     */
    // When the shouldComponentUpdate returns true componentWillUpdate is run
    componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
        // perform any preparations for an upcoming update
    }

    /**
     * @param prevProps {object}
     * @param prevState {object}
     */
    // When it is rendered the componentDidUpdate is called
    // Used to perform DOM operations after the data has been updated
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) { /**/ }

    /**
     * @param nextProps {object}
     */
// When it has rendered used after props have changed
    componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
        this.setState({
            // set something
        });
    }

    // Is called before the render method is executed.
    // Setting the state in this phase will not trigger a re-rendering.
    componentWillMount() { /**/ }

    // when the component output has been rendered to the DOM componentDidMount is run
    componentDidMount() { /**/ }

    // When it is removed from the DOM componentWillUnmount is called
    componentWillUnmount() { /**/ }

}
</code>
</pre>

<p>connectCallBack and disconnectedCallback in Web Components and componentWillMount and componentWillUnmount in React play similar roles. </p>

<p>Although there is only one method, attributeChangedCallback, in Web Components objects for handling data changes, and has to be used with the mutationObserver:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
class ExampleElement extends HTMLElement {

    constructor() {
        super();
        // no inspecting attributes or children!
    }

    static get observedAttributes() {
        return ['selected'];
    }

    attributeChangedCallback(attrName, oldVal, newVal) {
        // An attribute was added, removed, updated or replaced
        // Also called for initial values when
        // an element is created by the parser, or
        // upgraded
        this[attrName] = newVal;
    }

    // synchronise attribute and properties

    set selected(value) {
        if (Object.is(this._selected, value)) {
            return;
        }
        this._selected = value;
    }

    get selected() {
        return this._selected;
    }

}
</code>

<p>During the coming weeks, I’ll be publishing a series of articles on Web Components that will cover accessibility, progressive enhancement, the forthcoming release of Polymer 2.0, a comparison of how both React and Web Components interact with CSS and HTML, how Web Components v1 can be used in a React build today, and TDD methods for both.</p>

<p>For now, if you are interested in investigating Web Components further, then I recommend reading "<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/customelements" rel="external" class="underline">Custom Elements v1: Reusable Web Components</a>" and "<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/shadowdom" rel="external" class="underline">Shadow DOM v1: Self-Contained Web Components</a>", written by Google employee and <a href="https://ericbidelman.tumblr.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Polymer developer Eric Bidelman</a>.</p>


Stripping out React / Redux development code in production builds using Webpack

React

<p>When using React / Redux there are a lots of third-party modules and browser extensions that aid the development process. Obviously, during these need to be removed in production builds.</p>

<p>The most suitable Webpack plugin for this job is the Yahoo-sponsored <a href="https://github.com/yahoo/strip-loader" rel="external" class="underline">strip-loader</a>.</p>

<p>The Webpack config settings are written as so:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
 {
     test: /\.js$/,
     loader: 'strip-loader?strip[]=debug,strip[]=console.log,strip[]=console.dir'
 }
</code>
</pre>

<p>With the above code strips out all console.log and console.dir methods and all functions named debug.</p>

<p>In may index file I use <a href="https://github.com/dylanb/react-axe" rel="external" class="underline">react-axe</a> for accessibility audits and use session storage for the most frequent API call. With the debug functions it reads:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
function debug() {

  const axe = require('react-axe'); // eslint-disable-line
  const SESSION_STORAGE = require('./util/sessionStorage'); // eslint-disable-line

  axe(React, ReactDOM, 1000);

  // create basic local data cache for the most popular posts
  store.subscribe(() => {

    if (Object.keys(store.getState().popular).length > 0) {
      SESSION_STORAGE.default.saveState(store.getState().popular);
    }

  });

}

debug();
</code>
</pre>

<p>In a separate file I use <a href="https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger" rel="external" class="underline">redux-logger</a> in the middleware, and the <a href="https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension" rel="external" class="underline">redux-devtools-extension</a> to allow for very comprehensive redux debugging in the Chrome browser:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
import reduxThunk from 'redux-thunk';
import {
    createStore,
    applyMiddleware,
    compose
} from 'redux';
import {
    autoRehydrate
} from 'redux-persist';

import reducers from './reducers';

const middleWare = [reduxThunk];

let composeEnhancers = compose;

function debug() {
    composeEnhancers = require('redux-devtools-extension').composeWithDevTools; // eslint-disable-line
    middleWare.push(require('redux-logger')()); // eslint-disable-line
}

debug();

const createStoreWithMiddleware = composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(...middleWare), autoRehydrate())(createStore);

const store = createStoreWithMiddleware(reducers);

export default store;
</code>
</pre>

<p>I have a tendency to become a little neurotic when formatting code, so it would be preferable for strip-loader to be able to remove Immediately Invoked Function Expressions [IIFE], but unfortunately, this style doesn’t work:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
(function debug() {

  const axe = require('react-axe'); // eslint-disable-line
  const SESSION_STORAGE = require('./util/sessionStorage'); // eslint-disable-line

  axe(React, ReactDOM, 1000);

  // create basic local data cache for the most popular posts
  store.subscribe(() => {

    if (Object.keys(store.getState().popular).length > 0) {
      SESSION_STORAGE.default.saveState(store.getState().popular);
    }

  });

}());
</code>
</pre>

Changing file permissions (Mac OS)

CLI

<p>I’ve just recently had an case where all npm command line use necessitated an instruction for superuser privileges before executed, so ‘yarn run install’ became ‘sudo yarn run install’ and so on. Typing your OS password before every command line action instruction grows tiresome very, very quickly. In addition, all files and directories created or moved through the command line had read-only status.</p>

<p>I fixed this problem by changing the user permissions on the following folders.</p>

<pre class="language-text">
<code>
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib/node_modules
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /path/to/current/working/directory
</code>
</pre>

<p>As of writing this post a day later, I have yet to see a recurrence of the same problem.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of months I’ve been reviewing my work aims for 2017. I have been a contractor for four years, with most of that period spent working with Angular.</p>

<p>I’ve been employed on three major Angular projects: Tesco’s Blinkbox, Sainsbury’s Digital and Boots BetaLab. The digital departments of these retail giants, and the websites created for them, no longer exist.</p>

<p>Tesco’s Blinkbox was an early adopter of Angular. Then, we were still building for Internet Explorer 8, so we used, as an example of multi-browser compatibility, the hashbang URL rather than the History API.</p>

<p>At the time, there weren’t commonly followed best practices for Angular. John Papa’s <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide" rel="external" class="underline">Angular Style Guide</a> was in the process of being popularised. For all the developers working on the project it was our first Angular site, and my fondest memories of this contract were working with the amenable Spanish developers in my Scrum group.</p>

<p>At Sainsbury’s Digital, the Angular architecture was built around RequireJS. What’s more, it was an idiosyncratic implementation of the publicly documented hybrid RequireJS/Angular build. RequireJS implements the asynchronous module definition (AMD) specification. This is a convoluted, unwieldy module system that is now largely redundant as <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/" rel="external" class="underline">ES6 modules</a> have become standard.</p>

<p>I was the first person on the CMS admin Scrum team and I made two mistakes. Rather than refactoring out the RequireJS, I chose to continue with the existing architecture. I felt this would result in the least disruption, but use of RequireJS was a continuous hindrance. Secondly, I should have adopted a CSS library. There were no funds for design or UX work in the admin section, so we coded our own design. It’s highly inadvisable to give developers responsibility for the design: this is not where their strengths lie. Using a CSS library would have added more uniformity to the extensive forms in the admin section. Complex forms are, in my opinion, the most time-consuming part of any web build as they require particularly intense design, UX and coding work.</p>

<p>It was understandable, after launch, that the users commented: can’t we have it more like WordPress?</p>


<p>My last big project with Angular was Boots BetaLab. The aim was to create an in-store kiosk that allowed shoppers to find and order items not available on the shelves. Before my contract, I had taken a few months off to attend several large European web developer conferences and to become more familiar with ES6 (or ES2015, as it is now officially labelled). This time, the Angular setup was far more mature than in previous builds, with ES6 classes substituting named functions in the components; Webpack module builder replacing the Grunt task runner and Gulp streaming build system; and <a href="https://github.com/kensho/ng-describe" rel="external" class="underline">ng-describe</a> being added to the test flow to reduce boilerplate code. The latter, deceased, in my estimate, writing tests to 10% of developer time, whereas before it had been 20–30%.</p>

<p>When the crunch came (and it was a severe one), bad practices such as passing data through scope events and not writing tests were allowed through code reviews, and, once that happened, the gates of hell opened.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with MVC (and variations of that design pattern) on the frontend is that it allows for the liberal passing of data between components. In Angular, the component layers are services, controllers and directives, but passing data between directives is also common.</p>

<p>When I first used React for a project (version 0.13) with Flux, its most impressive feature was the unidirectional data flow. I also liked the JSX syntax and CSS modules (although the latter can now be used with any JavaScript framework, it was the React ecosystem that introduced it to the world).</p>

<p>Over the winter I spent a lot of time with Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. When used with React, it added a lot of complexity to the build by creating an abstraction (Redux is based on Flux) on top of an abstraction (React and Flux) that sits on the web layer.</p>

<p>It’s an approach that encourages cynical tweets like this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have reinvented Java, complete with ServiceProviders and XML configuration. Now, we are truly ready for the enterprise. <a href="https://t.co/8hAcTxJgs2">https://t.co/8hAcTxJgs2</a></p>&mdash; Domenic Denicola (@domenic) <a href="https://twitter.com/domenic/status/817617569934934016">January 7, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>It’s clear, though, that React, or, at least, the approaches that it brings to frontend development, is as fundamental as jQuery was in the last decade.</p>

<p>It is important, although not essential, to use Redux-based third-party libraries like <a href="http://redux-form.com/6.4.3/" rel="external" class="underline">Redux Form</a>. A sign of a healthy open source project is the quantity and quality of third-party libraries. It was in the later stages of Angular version one that libraries like <a href="http://angular-formly.com/#/" rel="external" class="underline">Angular Formly</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kensho/ng-describe" rel="external" class="underline">ng-describe</a> were established. This proved to be a great help to productivity. An attractive aspect of Redux is its third-party ecosystem, but with that comes the price of greater cognitive load as one attempts to master these libraries. React/Redux seems to be a particularly fast-moving project. An example of this speed can be illustrated by the breaking changes in Redux Form from version five to six. Online tutorials, like
Stephen Grider’s <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview" rel="external" class="underline">Modern React with Redux</a>, struggle to match this pace.</p>

<p>However, Redux is a state management tool independent from React, and is bound together with the <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux" rel="external" class="underline">React Redux</a> module. Beyond partnering with React, it is now being used with <a href="https://github.com/angular-redux/ng-redux" rel="external" class="underline">Angular</a> and <a href="https://reduxframework.com/" rel="external" class="underline">WordPress</a>. As Redux spreads, the need to master it becomes even more imperative.</p>

<p>Other than spending time with React/Redux (and, hopefully, some Vue.js too), my other aims include:</p>

<h3>More regular blogging</h3>

<p>I aim to write one article per week throughout 2017. If each post is approximately 1,000 words, then that totals 52,000 words for the entire year. This goal is achievable with the right discipline, although it will be difficult.</p>

<h3>A deeper understanding of Git</h3>

<p>I use Git daily, but it would be an advantage to attain a deeper knowledge of this distributed version control system. As of May 2014, 42.9% of professional software developers were reporting that they used Git as their primary source control system (source: The Eclipse Foundation), but on the frontend it is so ubiquitous that it must be closer to 100%.</p>

<h3>UNIX command line</h3>

<p>My academic background isn’t computer science related, and I’ve only recently been using the UNIX command line beyond basic Mac commands. It came to my attention last year that it is possible to use NPM scripts without a task runner. After a lot of experimenting I concluded that using a build tool, like Webpack and Gulp, with the command line is the best approach. My aim in 2016 is to record my current command of UNIX in blog posts, expanding my knowledge once I have assessed my current level of understanding.</p>

<h3>Reading more deeply about agile</h3>

<p>The book in 2016 that inspired me most was David West’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Thinking-Developer-Reference-DV-Microsoft-Professional/0735619654" rel="external" class="underline" rel="external" class="underline">Object Thinking</a>. It was a joyful discovery. This year, I will investigate agile from a practical and theoretical angle. As it is actually the latter that interests me more, the theory is the foundation for its practice.</p>

<h3>Watch at least one full tutorial every month</h3>

<p>There are lots of great online video tutorial sites in existence, with <a href="https://egghead.io/" rel="external" class="underline">Egghead</a> and <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> being two that I regularly use. I’m sure it’s possible to undertake a course at least once a month.</p>

Work goals for 2017

General


Your blog is both your personality and your playground: treasure it

General

<p>It has been a little surprising to watch as developers have embraced <a href="https://medium.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Medium</a>, turning it into a vault of useful technical information, robust opinion and considered reflection.</p>

<p>The first golden era of blogging, lasting much of the last decade, is over. The principal reason isn’t that the fire in the author’s belly has been extinguished, but that search engine traffic has withered. The ubiquitous blog comments section, once fat with thought and overloaded with spam, has quietened. Enter “death of blogging” into a search engine and scan the results. It makes for interesting reading.</p>

<p>Some years ago, Google modified their algorithms, boosting “authoritative sites” over amateur content. Google didn’t declare war on blogs; they were just the unfortunate casualty of a battle against commercially-created, untrustworthy information found on sites whose only purpose was to game search engine rankings.</p>

<p>Opinion has also found a welcoming embrace on social media, pulling it away from individual blogs towards web platforms that act as closed digital behemoths.</p>

<p>It needs to be noted, too, that the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mattlynley/google-reader-died-because-no-one-would-run-it?utm_term=.epE3BMEx3#.biek382Qk" rel="external" class="underline">closure of Google Reader in 2013</a> has dented traffic to blogs. Many Google Reader devotees migrated to other platforms (in my case to <a href="https://www.newsblur.com/" rel="external" class="underline">NewsBlur</a>), but lots of others permanently turned away from an RSS reader.</p>

<p>Medium has always labelled itself as a publishing, rather than a blogging, platform – offering an aesthetic shine to the stale blogger.com format.</p>

<p>Web developers quickly colonised the website and its myriad orbiting microsites to express thoughts on all aspects of the industry.</p>

<p>The surprise, for me, is that coders were seemingly the least likely online demographic to willingly surrender their personal blogs. Blog code, generated through WordPress, Ghost or bespoke sites, is in itself a statement, just as much as the written word on the page.</p>

<p>A blog, for a web developer, is a playground of ideas. This is where one can experiment with the latest optimisation techniques, programming languages, CSS tricks and accessibility standards. It offers the coder a space to perfect a craft that commercial pressure in our day jobs prohibits.</p>

<p>This site was constructed nearly two years ago when Angular client-side rendering, Grunt task runner and JavaScript Code Style (JSCS) checker were at their most prominent. If I were to build a bespoke blog in 2017, I would avoid all these technologies.</p>

<p>In the past two years I have routinely returned to the codebase, enthusiastically mixing React with the Angular view layer (not recommended), tweaking pre-browsing techniques against WebPagetest measurements (worth trying) and painting Node.js onto a blank server-side canvas (great fun).</p>

<p>The codebase now flows between an ill-disciplined mess and reasonably majestic code components. But it’s my site, and I can do what I want with it. If it fails, it does so through good intentions, not sloppy indifference.</p>

<p>The same, too, stands for the consistency of the blog articles. Although some items are mediocre, I’m particularly proud of other articles – <em><a href="https://andywalpole.me/blog/144785/nodejs-politics-is-suicide-painless" rel="external" class="underline">On Node.js and politics: is suicide painless?</a></em> and <em><a href="https://andywalpole.me/blog/139947/fear-technology" rel="external" class="underline">Fear technology?</a></em> being two. </p>

<p>This site, in its entirety, is a statement I make to the world. Whereas if I participated in Medium, I would have been an extremely minor storyteller surrounded by legions of other writers. It’s somebody else’s vision, not mine.</p>

<p>Now Medium, through its CEO Evan Williams, has announced a <a href="https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be#.wlcd4n9n0" rel="external" class="underline">strategic retreat</a>. A business model built on advertising is, according to Williams, unviable; one third of their workforce is to be made redundant and unspecified fundamental changes are to be made to the platform. The continuity of existing content has not been threatened, but it would be unwise to presume that articles are to be left as they are given that "major changes" and "a different—and bolder—approach" have been promised. Now is the time to back up precious copy in case an off switch is flipped.</p>

<p>I hope that the developers who exclusively publish on Medium do not go gently into that good night. The content they publish is vital to our community because they facilitate an exchange of ideas in the midst of relentless technological change. To appropriate the words of George Jackson: "Nothing stays the same, not even for an instant. If a thing isn’t growing, it’s decaying" (<em>Soledad Brother</em>). Right now, we need to hear the voices of our engineering outliers just as much as we do our provocative agitators.</p>

<p>If Medium, as a people carrier, retreats from the battlefield, then the bloody infantry need to build their own vehicles – let the blog rise again. I’m sure we can find the means of facilitating publicity that connects an eager audience with quality articles. There is already some means of doing so through curated email lists like <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/" rel="external" class="underline">JavaScript Weekly</a>, <a href="http://responsivedesignweekly.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Responsive Design Weekly</a> and <a href="http://webtoolsweekly.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Web Tools Weekly</a>.</p>

<p>For my own part, I have made a commitment to write one article a week for the whole of 2017. If each post is approximately 1,000 words, that equates to 52,000 words in total. To achieve this aim, I will require a far higher level of personal discipline than I displayed in 2016.</p>

To every thing there is a season


General

<p>Last year was a tumultuous time for me. The mistakes seemed to roll quicker than the successes, so I spent the last few months of 2016 away from commercial work in order to rethink aspects of my life. I enter 2017 somewhat bruised, but with an awareness of where my weaknesses lie and a plan for how to manage them.</p>

<p>I face considerable challenges in 2017, but I have the loving support of friends and family, which I am grateful for. The words of songsmith Joe Strummer seem opportune: ‘Without people you are nothing’.</p>

<p>But the motivation for personal change must ultimately be found within. That fortitude, an inner light of grit and determination, propels one out of bed in the morning to make the right choices at the right times.</p>

<p>I grew up with the Christian tradition, and although I’m no longer a part of that, Biblical passages are a part of my knowledge. One passage in particular, Ecclesiastes 3, serves as an inspiration:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:<br>
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;<br>
A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;<br>
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;<br>
A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;<br>
A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;<br>
A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;<br>
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ecclesiastes 3 was also an influence on atheist Pete Seeger, who, in the late 1950s, crafted it into a song that, in the hands of the Byrds, became their sublime 1965 hit single ‘Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)’.</p>

<p>The late 1950s, for Pete Seeger, must have surely been the bleakest point in his long life in politics and music. Hounded by vicious McCarthyism, he must have questioned whether hope would ever return. One can only imagine the immense, suffocating weariness that a person like Seeger would have had to endure because of the persecution that his beliefs provoked in the rabid conservative zeitgeist of that period.</p>

<p>When he crafted Ecclesiastes 3 into a song, he sought refuge in its message: today may be a time for weeping and mourning, but the rhythm of life means that tomorrow will be a time for dancing and laughing. Nothing is a constant – all is subject to change.</p>

<p>Pete Seeger is no longer with us – his time to die came in 2014 – but his work remains for us to reflect upon in our own seasons of change.</p>

<p>Spending time on a Buddhist retreat in 2016 brought me closer to the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. Our unfettered desires will destroy us – if we allow them to. And although the seasons of life will pass over us, uninvited, our response can be robustly crafted like a well-constructed song.</p>

<p>2017 will be a year where I will open up to myself and those around me. It’s a year in which to access wisdom and experience, which is within easy access if one intentionally seeks it out.</p>

Essential Git commands – part one

GIT

<p>Git is the industry-standard version control system that has replaced the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) commonly used in the previous two decades.</p>

<p>Created by Linux guru Linus Torvalds over ten years ago, it is commonly acknowledged that its major advantage over CVS is its decentralised architecture, which makes it easier to develop concurrently and collaboratively with others.</p>

<p>Torvalds claims that it was created in “<a href="https://www.linux.com/blog/10-years-git-interview-git-creator-linus-torvalds" rel="external" class="underline">ten days or so</a>”, and, in <a href="http://typicalprogrammer.com/linus-torvalds-goes-off-on-linux-and-git" rel="external" class="underline">this amusing interview from 2012</a>, programmer Greg Jorgensen wryly comments on its complexity:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://typicalprogrammer.com/linus-torvalds-goes-off-on-linux-and-git"><p>I didn’t really expect anyone to use it because it’s so hard to use, but that turns out to be its big appeal…</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://typicalprogrammer.com/linus-torvalds-goes-off-on-linux-and-git"><p>You’ll spend a lot of time trying to get your head around it, and being ridiculed by the experts on GitHub and elsewhere. I’ve learned that no toolchain can be too complicated because the drive for prestige and job security is too strong. Eventually you’ll discover the Easter egg in Git: all meaningful operations can be expressed in terms of the rebase command. Once you figure that out it all makes sense.</p></blockquote>

<p>At an advanced level, Git is intimidatingly complex, but regular, everyday use will only require the repetitious use of several key commands. I present some of these below.</p>

<p>Although there are several Git clients available, I would recommend the use of the command line when utilising Git for projects.</p>

<h3>Creating branches</h3>

<p>Creating new branches in Git is incredibly easy.</p>

<p>First of all, ensure that you are in the master branch:</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git checkout master
</code>
</pre>

<p>From there, create and transfer yourself into a new branch on your local repro:</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git checkout -b brand-new-branch
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Committing branches</h3>

<p>After code has been written, list the files changed with the status keyword:</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git status
</code>
</pre>

<p>Although it is possible to selectively commit individual branches or directories, on nine out of ten occasions I will select all the file changes to be committed:</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git add -A
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now add a commit message. This only needs to be a single sentence, but you should ensure that it is an unambiguous, clear statement. Remember that your work colleagues will refer to this commit message when reviewing your code.</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git commit -m ‘refactored emailErrorDisplay method to make it less verbose’
</code>
</pre>

<p>It now involves a simple push to the remote branch:</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git push origin brand-new-branch
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Merging branches and rebasing</h3>

<p>After work on the branch has finished and it has passed code review, it will need to be merged into the master branch.</p>

<p>The simplest way of doing this is by merging the branch into the master:</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git merge brand-new-branch
</code>
</pre>

<p>But by using rebase first you will have a much cleaner, linear commit tree that avoids spaghetti-history. Using rebase means making a decision based on how you want your history to appear, with commits, after rebasing, sitting at the top of the commit history.</p>

<p>However, reverting a rebase is considerably more difficult than reverting a merge, making the latter preferable if reversion is likely. </p>

<p>I recommend reading Nathan Leclaire’s ‘<a href="https://nathanleclaire.com/blog/2014/09/14/dont-be-scared-of-git-rebase/" rel="external" class="underline">Don’t Be Scared of Git Rebase</a>’ blog, which offers a far more eloquent explanation of the benefits of rebasing.</p>

<p>Decisions on rebasing should be made at the group level so that everybody is using the same approach.</p>

<p>The final paragraph of the relevant chapter in the expansive <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/ch3-6.html" rel="external" class="underline">Git guide</a> sagely advises the following:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://typicalprogrammer.com/linus-torvalds-goes-off-on-linux-and-git"><p>In general the way to get the best of both worlds is to rebase local changes you’ve made but haven’t shared yet before you push them in order to clean up your story, but never rebase anything you’ve pushed somewhere.</p></blockquote>

<p>To rebase the local branch with a remote master, do the following:</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Deleting branches</h3>

<p>The most straightforward way of deleting branches on both the local and remote repositories is as follows.</p>

<p>The following command will list all branches:</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git branch -a
</code>
</pre>

<p>This will delete the local branch:</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git branch -d branch-to-delete
</code>
</pre>

<p>Once this is completed, delete the branch on the remote repro:</p>

<pre class="language-git">
<code>
git push --delete origin branch-to-delete
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Reverting changes</h3>

<p>Everybody messes up occasionally and needs to revert a working branch/master back to a previous state. It’s on these rare occasions that I have ended up creating a total mess, resulting in lost production time as I embarrassingly panic and then, frustrated, bleat to my scrum team for help.</p>

<p>A central benefit of using a control version system is the ability to constructively handle mistakes. However, because it happens so infrequently the commands for these actions are forgotten.</p>

<p>Etsy engineer <a href="http://sylormiller.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Katie Sylor-Miller</a> has helpfully listed several problems and solutions on a <a href="https://goo.gl/svPZL4" rel="external" class="underline">specially constructed ‘Git out of this mess’ site</a>. Bookmark this website! It could save you considerable time and help you avoid having egg on your face.</p>



MongoDB, the basics – part one

MongoDB

<p>Databases are a part of DevOps’‎ remit, but every developer should have a firm grasp of the basics. Up until two years ago, I was working exclusively on the LAMP stack, and although my knowledge of SQL allowed me to create and maintain a database, I was never enthusiastic enough to take my knowledge to any depth – the 800-page book High Performance MySQL sits on my shelf neither loved nor read to this very day.</p>

<p>Likewise with MongoDB. It’s important to have knowledge of CRUD operations and best practice for SCHEMA designs, but I stop short of any deep understanding of performance issues and the use of the aggregation framework.</p>

<p>Here are some basics that may be of use. </p>

<p>MongoDB is a non-relational database that stores JSON documents. Like all NoSQL databases, MongoDB is schemaless, so different documents can have different structures. This, in certain circumstances, is a liberating style if individual data items are likely to change in the future.</p>

<p>NoSQL is the best choice when the datasets are expected to be fluid – expanding and shrinking to a non-predefined structure.</p>

<p>The downside of using MongoDB is that it’s difficult to do joins unless you use the aggregation framework. However, if combining records from multiple tables is an essential feature you are more likely to choose a relational database, such as SQL.</p>

<p>MongoDB can be used on the command line with the mongo shell, and although it’s certainly essential knowledge for DevOps, perhaps it’s not so important to full-stack developers who are accessing the database through Node.js.</p>

<h3>Using MongoDB with Node.js</h3>

<p>Most developers use MongoDB on the Node.js platform through <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose" rel="external" class="underline">Mongoose</a> ODM. This removes much of the complexity when accessing MongoDB directly. However, there is another option when using Node.js with MongoDB – using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb" rel="external" class="underline">driver</a> on its own.</p>

<p>Presuming that you have the correct dependencies installed, below are some usable MongoDB driver code snippets.</p>

<p>The first line of code allows access to the MongoClient object:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
</code>
</pre>

<p>The second line uses the connect method to access the database:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/example', function(err, db) {
    if(err) {
throw err;
}

// db stuff here

 db.close();

});
</code>
</pre>

<p>The value entered into the callback function, connect, is the host and port number followed by the database name.</p>

<h3>findOne</h3>

<p>I used the dataset of restaurants as <a href="https://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/import-data/" rel="external" class="underline">available to download from the MongoDB website</a>.</p>

<p>Below is a JSON object representative of a document structure:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
{
    "address": {
        "building": "5614"
        "coord": [
            -73.9215679,
            40.629896
        ],
        "street": "Flatlands Ave",
        "zipcode": "11234"
    },
    "borough": "Brooklyn",
    "cuisine": "Other",
    "grades": [],
    "name": "K One Buffet",
    "restaurant_id": "50018727"
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>findOne is one of the most basic query methods. In the code snippet below, the address with the building number of 338 is being queried.</p>

<p>The callback returns either an error or the entire document.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'use strict';
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

// Open the connection to the server
MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/example', function(err, db) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  let query = { 'address.building' : '338' };

  // Find one document in our collection
  db.collection('restaurants').findOne({query}, function(err, doc) {

    if (err) {
      throw err;
    }

    // Print the result.
    // Will print a null if there are no documents in the db.
    console.dir(doc);

    // Close the DB
    db.close();
  });
</code>
</pre>

<h3>find</h3>

<p>To find more than one entry, it is necessary to use the find method on the collection object. The toArray callback, unsurprisingly, returns the results as an array:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'use strict';
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

// Open the connection to the server
MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/example', function(err, db) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  let query = { 'address.building' : '338' };

  db.collection('restaurants').find(query).toArray(function(err, result) {

    if (err) {
      throw new Error(err);
    }

    console.dir(result);

    db.close();
  });

});
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Using the projection field</h3>

<p>It is possible to increase the complexity of the database query by using the projection parameter in the find method.</p>

<p>The projection parameter is used to specify which fields you wish to return. Below, we specify that we want just the address and not the _id field.</p>

<p>Field projection is a superb way of limiting the amount of data returned, reducing API call times in the process.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'use strict';
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

// Open the connection to the server
MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/example', function(err, db) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  let query = {'address.building': '338'};

  let projection = {'address': 1, '_id': 0};

  db.collection('restaurants').find(query, projection).toArray(function(err, result) {

    if (err) {
      throw new Error(err);
    }

    console.dir(result);

    db.close();
  });

});
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is the returned array:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
[
    {
        address: {
            building: '338',
            coord: [
                Object
            ],
            street: 'McGuinessBoulevard',
            zipcode: '11222'
        }
    },

        }
    },
    {
        address: {
            building: '338',
            coord: [
                Object
            ],
            street: 'West46Street',
            zipcode: '10036'
        }
    },
    {
        address: {
            street: '9Avenue',
            zipcode: '10001',

            coord: [
                Object
            ]
        }
    },
    {
        address: {
            building: '338',
            coord: [
                Object
            ],
            street: 'KnickerbockerAvenue',
            zipcode: '11237'
        }
    },
    {
        address: {
            coord: [
                Object
            ],
            street: 'BedfordAve',

        }
    }
]

</pre>

<h3>Using $gt and $lt </h3>

<p>Using the $gt and $lt operators is a means of filtering data.</p>

<p>In the query below, we are specifying that the address building number should be between 700 and 800:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
let query = {'address.building': {'$gt': 700, '$lt': 800}};
</code>
</pre>

<p>With the dataset that I am using, this actually returns an empty array. This is because the building numbers are stored as strings rather than digits. There are ways of working around type conflicts, but the best method is to make sure that you have the right schema in the first place.</p>

<h3>Using $regex</h3>

<p>Regular expressions, commonly known as regex, shouldn’t require any explanation. They have been used in computer programming since the 1950s, with their power lying in their simplicity.</p>

<p>You can use regex in JavaScript, and in MongoDB database query strings too.</p>

<p>Below returns results with boroughs that contain 'Bro', which, from the current dataset, means all restaurants in either Brooklyn or the Bronx.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'use strict';
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

// Open the connection to the server
MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/example', function(err, db) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  let query = {'borough': {'$regex': 'Bro'}};

  let projection = {'borough': 1, '_id': 0};

  db.collection('restaurants').find(query, projection).toArray(function(err, result) {

    if (err) {
      throw new Error(err);
    }

    console.dir(result);

    db.close();
  });

});
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Sort, skip, limit</h3>

<p>Sort, skip and limit are ways in which it is possible to alter the data that is returned.</p>

<p>The code example below skips the first 10 entries and returns 30 documents sorted by the street name in reverse alphabetical order.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'use strict';
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

// Open the connection to the server
MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/example', function(err, db) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  let projection = {'address': 1, '_id': 0};

  let options = {
    'skip': 10,
    'limit': 30,
    'sort': {'address.street': -1}
  };

  db.collection('restaurants').find({}, projection, options).toArray(function(err, result) {

    if (err) {
      throw new Error(err);
    }

    console.dir(result);
    db.close();
  });

});
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Insert</h3>

<p>Now we have covered queries, let’s look at manipulating data starting with insert.</p>

<p>Below we enter a new document into the database:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'use strict';
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

// Open the connection to the server
MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/example', function(err, db) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  let doc = {
    'address': {
      'building': '5613',
      'coord': [
        -73.9215679,
        40.629896
      ],
      'street': 'Flatlands Hill',
      'zipcode': '123456'
    },
    'borough': 'Brooklyn',
    'cuisine': 'Other',
    'grades': [],
    'name': 'Andy\'s Buffet',
    'restaurant_id': '50234727'
  };

  db.collection('restaurants').insert(doc, function(err, inserted) {
    if(err) {
      throw err;
    }

    console.dir('Successfully inserted: ' + JSON.stringify(inserted));

    return db.close();
  });

});
</code>
</pre>

<p>The returned object reads:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'Successfully inserted: {"result":{"ok":1,"n":1},"ops":[{"address":{"building":"5613","coord":[-73.9215679,40.629896],"street":"Flatlands Hill","zipcode":"123456"},"borough":"Brooklyn","cuisine":"Other","grades":[],"name":"Andy\'s Buffet","restaurant_id":"50234727","_id":"565498797a606466369918e2"}],"insertedCount":1,"insertedIds":["565498797a606466369918e2"]}'
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<p>The first code snippet, below, is a rather verbose way of updating a document. Firstly, it uses the findOne method to ensure that the document exists, if it does, then the update method is used.</p>

<p>The returned document from the first query is passed as an argument into the second, but to ensure that we are 100% confident of updating the correct document, the _id is passed by value to the query object:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
query['_id'] = doc['_id'];
</code>
</pre>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'use strict';
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/example', function(err, db) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  let query = {'address.building': '338'};

  db.collection('restaurants').findOne(query, function(err, doc) {
    if (err) {
      throw err;
    }

    if (!doc) {
      console.log('No documents for assignment ' + query.assignment + ' found!');
      return db.close();
    }

    query['_id'] = doc['_id'];
    doc['address']['street'] = doc['address.street'] + ' and extend the street';

    db.collection('restaurants').update(query, doc, function(err, updated) {
      if (err) {
        throw err;
      }

      console.dir('Successfully updated ' + updated + ' document!');

      return db.close();
    });
  });
});
</code>
</pre>

<p>A shorter method of achieving the update would be to use the $set operator:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'use strict';
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/example', function(err, db) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  let query = {'address.building': '338'};
  let operator = {'$set': {'address.street': '3744 James Road'}};

  db.collection('restaurants').update(query, operator, function(err, updated) {
    if (err) {
      throw err;
    }

    console.dir('Successfully updated ' + updated + ' document!');

    return db.close();
  });
});
</code>
</pre>

<p>The above will only update one document, but by passing a third parameter to the update method with the multi-value set to true, all documents with the address number of 338 will be updated:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
let options = {'multi': true};
</code>
</pre>

<p>A different option would be to pass upsert with a value of true; this results in the updating of a document, but if that document doesn’t exist, then a new document is created:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
let options = {'upsert': true};
</code>
</pre>

<h3>findAndModify</h3>

<p>findAndModify is the optimal way of updating a single document, although the method is somewhat more complex because it takes four arguments.</p>

<p>In the code snippet below, sort allows greater query precision, while new set to the value of true means that the altered document is returned. If new were set to false, then the original document would be returned.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'use strict';
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/example', function(err, db) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  let query = {'address.building': '338'};
  var sort = [];
  let operator = {'$set': {'address.street': '3745 James Road'}};
  var options = {'new': true};

  db.collection('restaurants').findAndModify(query, sort, operator, options, function(err, doc) {
    if (err) {
      throw err;
    }

    if (!doc) {
      console.log('No document was found.');
    } else {
      console.dir(doc);
    }

    return db.close();
  });
});
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Remove</h3>

<p>Lastly, our CRUD knowledge needs details of how to delete a document.</p>

<p>The next code snippet finds all addresses with the street 3745 James Road, and returns the number of delete documents in the callback.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
'use strict';
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/example', function(err, db) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  let query = {'address.street': '3745 James Road'};

  db.collection('restaurants').remove(query, function(err, removed) {
    if (err) {
      throw err;
    }

    console.dir('Successfully updated ' + removed + ' documents!');

    return db.close();
  });
});
</code>
</pre>

<p>In part two, I’ll be going through all the above again but with Mongoose.</p>

CSS3 Flexbox: “Don’t [use] them, as they are going to change”

CSS


<p>French citizen, Daniel Glazman, is the long-standing co-chair of the W3C CSS Working Group. It is this committee, comprising browser vendors and other industry forces, that formulates, debates and promotes the CSS specification.</p>

<p>The short video below was taken at a web developer conference in 2014. To celebrate 20 years of CSS, Daniel’s presentation focused on the work of the W3C CSS Working Group.</p>

<p>With a wink to the frequent CSS bashing in web developer circles, the speaker acknowledges the strengths and weaknesses of both the methodology and the output of the committee.</p>

<p>If you find 20 minutes to spare, I’m sure that you’ll find this video rewarding to watch:</p>

<div class="video-container">
	<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9D4K8PrjhA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>One topic Daniel discusses is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/" rel="external" class="underline">CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1</a>, commonly known as Flexbox.</p>

<p>I’ve used Flexbox on three different projects, and my dissatisfaction with this CSS module seems to be at odds with the ‘Flexbox fever’ I witness every day on social media.</p>

<p>My scepticism is evidently shared by the W3C CSS co-chair, who informs the audience in his second language, English, that:</p>

<blockquote><p>When there is any hope to do something bad, we do it bad. Trust us. [Flexbox] is the result of hours and hours of discussion. Eventually we are going to change it. Don’t write them, as they are going to change.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Flexible Box Module is a complex mess created for a simple purpose: the ability to vertically centre an element on the page.</p>

<p>Daniel acknowledges that the five property values – flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between and space-around – follow an inconsistent naming convention, but this confusion is magnified because these values can be applied, in part or whole, to three different properties on the parent container: justify-content, align-items and align-content.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, browser bugs are a serious issue too. IE10 follows an earlier version of the spec, but IE11 has a very dodgy implementation. These are all catalogued by Philip Walton on this <a href="https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs" rel="external" class="underline">GitHub page</a>. </p>

<p>And, for a bit of extra fun, because we don’t already have enough problems with Flexbox, there can be <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2015/10/html-source-order-vs-css-display-order.html" rel="external" class="underline">accessibility issues when using the order property</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are using CSS Flexbox, don’t use order, as that can be a can of worms.</p></blockquote>

<p>For reasons stated above, using Flexbox on a web-based commercial project is not a wise choice. Perhaps it has value when used as part of a native app build, but I’m a web developer rather than a native app programmer, and I’m not in a position to give an opinion on this.</p>

<p>For now, I’m more optimistic about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-grid-1-20150917/" rel="external" class="underline">CSS Grid Layout Module</a>, which seems to be a far more inviting layout specification than Flexbox.</p>


On Node.js and politics: is suicide painless?

General

<p>Recently, a dispute broke out among Node.js contributors on the renaming of two technical terms used in the codebase: ‘kill’ and ‘suicide’. Here are <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/diversity/issues/9" rel="external" class="underline">some contributions to the thread</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’m :+1: on replacing problematic terminology gradually, with aliases. For the kill and suicide terms, it seems to me like stop and stopped actually makes more sense, especially across language barriers. The master and worker terminology could also be parent and child, which seems a bit friendlier.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Not a contributor, but -1 as a node user. This renaming potentially offensive terms is getting out of hand in the open source community. These unix terms have been around for years and they are fine. Who is even getting offended?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>i’d like to say that the people who have taken this thread as an opportunity to make jokes should take a serious look at their motivations for doing so. does the suggestion that this change be made make you uncomfortable? this is not a joke, and is a worthy issue.</p></blockquote>

<p>The argument is that these terms are offensive to those with mental health issues and so need to be neutrally renamed. This will then, so the argument runs, assist in greater project inclusivity.</p>

<p>‘Kill’ is a UNIX-derived term with a long history; ‘suicide’ isn’t, but I can guarantee that whoever introduced it into the Node.js codebase didn’t do so as a means of deriding those with a history of mental health problems.</p>

<h3>Politics and software</h3>

<p>As software plays such a fundamental role in our everyday lives, political debates around its use and implementation are to be expected.</p>

<p>The most prominent debate in recent years is concerning the issue of privacy. But accessibility is more than just a technical issue, because it encompasses a wide spectrum of society beyond digital online builds: It’s a political argument too. Equally, the ongoing discussion around gender imbalance in the workplace is a constructive political issue to be engaged with.</p>

<p>But this isn’t. It’s not ‘a worthy cause’. It is, primarily, a US-centric discourse, with vocabulary to match: ‘trigger warnings’ and ‘microaggression’ are terms that have very little context on this side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>A part of the US left seems obsessed with pushing these types of arguments as part of a progressive cause, but they are only of peripheral concern, at best, to the European left.</p>

<p>And it makes me furious. There are real fascists, racists and bigots to tackle, and choosing to campaign on perceived hurt through purely innocent labelling is preposterous.</p>

<p>To do so trivialises important issues, counterproductively making them seem ridiculous and infantile. It’s self-defeating and damaging.</p>

<p>In Europe, we have <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/10/polish-defence-minister-condemned-over-jewish-conspiracy-theory" rel="external" class="underline">government ministers who believe in the truthfulness of anti-Semitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/11960921/Sweden-conceals-refugee-centre-addresses-after-attacks.html" rel="external" class="underline">refugee centres that are being firebombed</a>, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/21/neo-fascist-greek-party-election-golden-dawn-third-place" rel="external" class="underline">uniformed Nazis marching again</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s focus our energy on campaigning against real bigotry, not imaginary foes.</p>

<p>In fact, I’m so mad about this that I’m going to have to unwind by watching the South Park episode ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunning_and_Brave" rel="external" class="underline">Stunning and Brave</a>’. That was a joke, but if your <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/3721#issuecomment-155537616" rel="external" class="underline">Code of Conduct bars humour</a>, then you need to get a grip on reality.</p>

<p>(Note: I originally wrote this a few days ago. The debate has, thankfully, moved on since then: <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/issues/19">https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/issues/19</a>. There are some quality contributions to that thread.)</p>

Fronteers Conference, Amsterdam, 8–9 October 2015

General

<p>I felt privileged to attend one of Europe’s top web developer conferences, Fronteers, in the beautiful city of Amsterdam during the early part of October.</p>

<p>Fronteers has become one of this continent’s most important gatherings for frontend developers and, if my positive experience is typical of other attendees, then this event deserves its place among other top-flight web developer conferences.</p>

<p>The venue was exquisite. Pathé Tuschinski is a cinema that was built in the 1920s and, with stunning architecture and quite possibly the world’s most comfortable seats, it’s difficult to think of a more suitable conference venue.</p>

<p>The organising was faultless. Everything ran smoothly and the lunch food was marvellous. Like many conferences, it was all organised by a team of volunteers.</p>

<p>The MC for Fronteers, Bruce Lawson, was the perfect choice.</p>

<p>Bruce successfully held court by fielding questions, suggested by the audience via Twitter, to the respective speakers, as well as asking intelligent questions of his own. He also successfully glued the sessions together by introducing each forthcoming speaker with a short but genuinely warm commentary.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if his sense of humour translated into all the cultural sensibilities of the multiple nationalities present in the audience, but I found his anti-reverential attitude hilarious.</p>

<p>I had originally met Bruce in person at the Edge conference in London in July. In the progressive enhancement workshop, I found him to be on the wrong side of confident, veering on cockiness.</p>

<p>Fronteers was the second time I had met this influential figure in the web development community, and I’ve come to appreciate what an asset he is to his employer, Opera browser.</p>

<p>Individuals like Bruce – as well as Christian Heilmann for Microsoft and Jake Archibald for Google – act as the ‘human face’ for their respective giant, multi-national companies. The fact that Apple has no such equivalent figure is one of the reasons why I hear Safari being openly derided at developer events in the same way that Internet Explorer was once bashed.</p>

<h4>The Art of Debugging – Remy Sharp</h4>

<p>Like any conference, not every single talk was pure gold. Some covered topics that I’m already very familiar with (of course, for others, these same talks may have been revelatory), but others covered fresh ground.</p>

<p>The standout presentation, if I were to pick one, would be Remy Sharp’s ‘The Art of Debugging’. Chrome’s DevTools are the most advanced of any comparable browser, and Remy’s talk detailed his best practices for using this toolset. Afterwards, I felt disappointed that I had missed his workshop, held on the day immediately preceding Fronteers.</p>

<p>The full talk, with video examples, is available on Remy’s personal blog: <a href="https://remysharp.com/2015/10/14/the-art-of-debugging" rel="external" class="underline">https://remysharp.com/2015/10/14/the-art-of-debugging</a>.</p>

<h4>Delivering Responsibly – Scott Jehl</h4>

<p>Scott Jehl, representing the <a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Filament Group</a>, gave an overview of the responsive design performance solutions that Filament have open sourced. These include: the npm <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/criticalcss"rel="external" class="underline">criticalCSS</a>, which extracts the most vital parts of a CSS page and inlines into the header of the HTML document; <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS" rel="external" class="underline">loadCSS</a>, a JavaScript solution to asynchronously load CSS; and <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadJS" rel="external" class="underline">loadJS</a>, for asynchronously loading JavaScript files.</p>

<p>He also, briefly, highlighted how HTTP/2 will alter web performance best practices, with JavaScript file concatenation becoming a performance anti-pattern.</p>

<p>I would recommend browsing through the dozens of projects published on the <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/" rel="external" class="underline">Filament Group GitHub account</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the slides for Scott’s talk: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9rGmqNcHo-mR0J3NHY3U0Qxc28/preview">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9rGmqNcHo-mR0J3NHY3U0Qxc28/preview</a><p>

<h4>Digital Governance – Lisa Welchman</h4>

<p>Lisa Welchman’s presentation on Digital Governance was more applicable to those working in large corporations. In a past contract, my employers were going through a digital governance audit and it was a massive endeavour. One part involved listing all live websites, with shocking forgotten digital relics being spewed up with other bile from the 1990s.</p>

<p>The slides for Lisa’s talk are here: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lisawelchman/managing-chaos-digital-governance-53752667">http://www.slideshare.net/lisawelchman/managing-chaos-digital-governance-53752667</a></p>

<h4>Lightning Fast Sass – Chris Eppstein</h4>

<p>Coming with important Sass news was Chris Eppstein. Chris was one of the original developers behind this pivotal frontend project, and his short talk announced the imminent demise of the Ruby-based compiler to be superseded by LibLAS, written in C++. The reason for this switch is the dramatic performance gains that a compiled language has over an interpreted language.</p>

<p>For the past 12 months, there has been a Sass feature block while the LibSass port reaches feature parity with its Ruby forbearer. This process is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>

<h4>Hands-On Web Audio – Soledad Penadés</h4>

<iframe src="https://vine.co/v/e0WlT2BEQXu/embed/simple?audio=1" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>According to the W3C specification, the <a href="http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/" rel="external" class="underline">Web Audio API</a> is: </p>

<blockquote><p>a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The primary paradigm is of an audio routing graph, where a number of AudioNode objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements on the web platform, notably: XMLHttpRequest [XHR] (using the responseType and response attributes). For games and interactive applications, it is anticipated to be used with the canvas 2D [2dcontext] and WebGL [WEBGL] 3D graphics APIs.</p></blockquote>

<p>HTML5 gave us the ability, some years ago, to embed video and audio files in an HTML document, but the lesser-known Web Audio is a browser API intended for advanced audio manipulation in games and interactive projects.</p>

<p>Soledad Penadés, a Mozilla “devevangineer”, inspired us with her presentation of Web Audio code and examples. Dazzled by the visual and audio stage show I missed much of the detail in the talk, but it seems that <a href="https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/" rel="external" class="underline">howler.js</a> is the recommended library for this API.</p>

<h4>An Introduction to Open Data – Sally Jenkinson / Freedom Can Be Designed – Rejo Zenger</h4>

</p>


<p>Thankfully, not every talk at Fronteers was technical. A good conference line-up allows room for presentations that promote debate – particularly on ethical issues.  </p>

<p>Rejo Zenger is an advocate of Netherlands digital civil rights organisation <a href="https://www.bof.nl/" rel="external" class="underline">Bits of Freedom</a>, and his topic – ‘Freedom Can Be Designed’ – focused on the post-Edward Snowden leaks security and privacy discourse.</p>

<p>If the Netherlands is viewed as a nation of liberal tolerance, then this is shaped more by the past than contemporary reality. In truth, the ruling authorities are just as suspicious towards online freedom, if not outright hostile, as any other European power. Their security service is firmly embedded in the attitude and practices of the operational framework created by other Western agencies – namely, the GCHQ and the NSA.</p>

<p>This, for Rejo, is more than a theoretical debate; it is one where a stand can be made through practical technical solutions: encrypt to the best of your abilities by deploying HTTPS, respect your customers’ privacy and don’t ask for more personal details than is absolutely necessary, and use <a href="http://piwik.org/" rel="external" class="underline">Piwik</a> open-source analytic tools and not Google’s closed propriety platform.</p>

<p>While Sally Jenkinson’s presentation on open data was highly professional, the content left me, on occasions, spitting blood.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, as Web 2.0 erupted, the goal of open data was lauded as a solution to help enforce governmental and corporate transparency. Ten years on, there has been little headway in releasing data for developers with user-friendly API access.</p>

<p>Open data brings up a lot of contentious issues. Bruce Lawson, introducing Sally, welcomed open data as a means of “holding our masters to account” – I, in turn, labelled his opinion as naive in a Twitter comment, because it’s the very same data accessed by our masters that can be used to maximise their profit and gain greater control of their consumers’ lives.</p>

<p>This issue is not a simple win for the little man or woman on the street. Insurance companies claim that open data would save them billions of dollars, and this outcome could be replicated across all sectors.</p>

<p>Looking at the issue of open data beyond a simplistic telling also means shining light on the grey areas that come with this topic.</p>

<h4>But What About Old Browsers?!? Embracing New CSS When Your Users Are Stuck in the Past – Rachel Andrew</h4>

</p>

<p>Rachel, a veteran in this sector, is a bit of a hero of mine. I admire her work ethic, which has led, over the years, to several published books and a commercially successful content management system, <a href="https://grabaperch.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Perch</a>.</p>

<p>Her talk at Fronteers focused on the CSS layout modules Flexbox and Grid Layout. She has taken a particular interest in the latter, articulating her issues of concern around the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-grid-1-20150917/" rel="external" class="underline">Grid Layout specification</a> to the W3C CSS Working Group and browser vendors.</p>

<p>Of the code examples presented from the platform, Grid Layout looks set to be a powerful, and much welcomed, CSS module. It is, unfortunately, currently only usable in Firefox and Chrome if the correct browser flags are set (see this caniuse.com Grid Layout entry for further details: <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid" rel="external" class="underline">http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid</a>).</p>

<p>Rachel explained that browser vendors are proceeding cautiously with this new CSS feature due to the Flexbox fiasco, which was the subject of several major specification redrafts. As this is such a vital new CSS module, I’m sure most web developers would show good grace to the browser vendors for slow implementation if this results in a bug-free Grid Layout.</p>

<p>Her book, <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/books/css3-layout-modules" rel="external" class="underline">CSS3 Layout Modules</a>, is now in its second edition, and covers Multi-column Layout, Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox), CSS Grid Layout, CSS Exclusions, CSS Shapes and CSS Regions.</p>

Moving from ES3/ES5 to ES6 JavaScript classes

JavaScript

<p>JavaScript is in a period of transition. The code that we’ll all be writing within a few years will bear little similarity to our current output.
</p>

<p>I call this transition period the “era of confusion”, as tools, such as transpilers, attempt to straddle the chasm between the two eras. It is a time of both experimentation and frustration as we gradually acclimatise to this new environment.</p>

<p>Unhelpfully, the overseeing standards body, Ecma International, has blown smoke into our eyes by renaming what was once called ECMAScript 6 (or ES6 in its diminutive form) to ECMAScript 2015. In <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/" rel="external" class="underline">this official document</a>, the full title reads “ECMA-262 6th Edition, The ECMAScript 2015 Language Specification”.</p>

<p>However, for the purpose of clarity, I shall keep to the older specification titles of ECMAScript versions 3, 5, 6 and 7, or just ES3 through to ES7 respectively (note: there was no ECMAScript version 4!).</p>

<h4>JavaScript and classes</h4>

<p>It has always been difficult to apply the terminology of classical programming languages to JavaScript.</p>

<p>Is it a functional programming language? It can be used in this paradigm, as Michael Fogus details in <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do" rel="external" class="underline">his 2013 publication</a>, but it almost never is. </p>

<p>Is it an object-orientated language? Sort of, but (nearly) everything in JavaScript is an object. Similarly, while it has always lacked explicit classes, there have been techniques for class emulation that have served the same purpose. So frequently, one would read references to JavaScript classes in tutorials and books , despite the classes’ absence.</p>

<p>The giant steps that are ES6 and its cousin ES7 are, at the core, a means of allowing JavaScript to be used at scale. For the first 10 to 15 years of its life, it was a client-side language that was used sparingly in the average build – most commonly for browser form validation, minor animation and, increasingly, client/server communication using the XMLHttpRequest API.</p>

<p>Matters began to change in 2009 with the first release of Node.js, which used a modified form of client-side JavaScript, labelled CommonJS. Then, in the succeeding years, Backbone, Angular and Ember took their inaugural steps as frameworks, following the model–view–controller (MVC) software architectural pattern.</p>

<p>But, while we required so much more from JavaScript, using the language at scale presented immense problems: not least its lack of inbuilt modularity, which is essential when taking an MVC approach.</p>

<h4>Differences between JavaScript and other programming languages</h4>

<p>It would be foolish of me even to attempt a succinct description of the differences between a prototype-based language like JavaScript and class-based programming languages.</p>

<p>This has been covered many times before by programming experts far more literate on this subject than myself.</p>

<p>But these slides, from a recent talk by <a href="http://ashleygwilliams.github.io/" rel="external" class="underline">Ashley Williams</a> at <a href="http://rejectjs.org/speakers/" rel="external" class="underline">Reject.JS</a>, neatly explain the difference:

</p>


<p>Although there are fundamental differences that are worth having an understanding of, they are unlikely to have an impact on 95% of your work.</p>

<h4>From ES5 to ES6 classes</h4>

<p>Technically, as previously explained, there are no classes in JavaScript, just objects. However, when explaining the language, it has been a common practice by many to alternate between informal and formal technical terms.</p>

<p>The basic ES6 class keywords can be mapped directly to ES5 function constructors. Below are comparable code examples as taken from Alex Bardanov’s project ‘<a href="https://github.com/dnbard/es6-guide" rel="external" class="underline">ES6 Guide</a>’ on GitHub. The code should be self-explanatory. </p>

<p>ECMAScript 5:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
function SkinnedMesh(geometry, materials) {
  this.idMatrix = SkinnedMesh.defaultMatrix();
  this.bones = [];
  this.boneMatrices = [];
}

SkinnedMesh.prototype.update = function update(camera) {
  Function.prototype.update.call(this);
};

SkinnedMesh.defaultMatrix = function defaultMatrix() {
  return new THREE.Matrix4();
};
</code>
</pre>

<p>ECMAScript 6:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
class SkinnedMesh {
  constructor(geometry, materials) {
    this.idMatrix = SkinnedMesh.defaultMatrix();
    this.bones = [];
    this.boneMatrices = [];
  }
  update(camera) {

  }
  static defaultMatrix() {
    return new THREE.Matrix4();
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<h4>ES6 <em>extends</em> and the extend function</h4>

<p>Subclassing with the <em>extends</em> keyword works as expected by using Object.create. This is demonstrated in the code below, which has been produced by transpiler Babel:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
function _inherits(subClass, superClass) {
    if (typeof superClass !== 'function' && superClass !== null) {
        throw new TypeError('Super expression must either be null or a function, not ' + typeof superClass)
    }
    subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, {
        constructor: {
            value: subClass,
            enumerable: false,
            writable: true,
            configurable: true
        }
    });
    if (superClass) Object.setPrototypeOf ? Object.setPrototypeOf(subClass, superClass) : subClass.__proto__ = superClass;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>However, there may be some confusion, as most existing libraries have an extend function.</p>

<p>One such library, Underscore, has <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#extend" rel="external" class="underline">_.extend</a>. In the example below, two shallow objects are merged into an empty object, with parameter values taking precedence from right to left:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
 var firstShallowbject = {
     id: 123,
     count: 41,
     desc: 'this is the description',
     title: 'This is the title',
     tag: 'JavaScript',
     values: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
 };
 var secondShallowbject = {
     count: 42,
     title: 'title for secondShallowbject',
     desc: 'description for secondShallowbject',
     values: [1, 3, 6, 10]
 };

 var extended = _.extend(Object.create(Object.prototype), firstShallowbject, secondShallowbject);

 console.log(JSON.stringify(extended));

 // {"id":123,"count":42,"desc":"description for secondShallowbject","title":"title for secondShallowbject","tag":"JavaScript","values":[1,3,6,10]}
</code>
</pre>


<p>It is possible to achieve the same results using <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/" rel="external" class="underline">jQuery extend</a>:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
 var firstShallowbject = {
     id: 123,
     count: 41,
     desc: 'this is the description',
     title: 'This is the title',
     tag: 'JavaScript',
     values: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
 };
 var secondShallowbject = {
     count: 42,
     title: 'title for secondShallowbject',
     desc: 'description for secondShallowbject',
     values: [1, 3, 6, 10]
 };

 var extended = jQuery.extend(Object.create(Object.prototype), firstShallowbject, secondShallowbject);

 console.log(JSON.stringify(extended));
 // {"id":123,"count":42,"desc":"description for secondShallowbject","title":"title for secondShallowbject","tag":"JavaScript","values":[1,3,6,10]}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Lodash, too, has an _.extend function, but it is now renamed <a href="https://lodash.com/docs#assign" rel="external" class="underline">_.assign</a>. This gives us a clue as to the fate of this popular utility feature.</p>

<p>The extend function is now a part of ES6 as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign" rel="external" class="underline">Object.assign</a>:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
 var firstShallowbject = {
     id: 123,
     count: 41,
     desc: 'this is the description',
     title: 'This is the title',
     tag: 'JavaScript',
     values: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
 };
 var secondShallowbject = {
     count: 42,
     title: 'title for secondShallowbject',
     desc: 'description for secondShallowbject',
     values: [1, 3, 6, 10]
 };

 var extended = Object.assign(Object.create(Object.prototype), firstShallowbject, secondShallowbject);

 console.log(JSON.stringify(extended));
// {"id":123,"count":42,"desc":"description for secondShallowbject","title":"title for secondShallowbject","tag":"JavaScript","values":[1,3,6,10]}
</code>
</pre>

<p>To clarify, the <em>extends</em> keyword in classes is different from the traditional extend library function.</p>

<h4>Are ES6 classes really just “syntactic sugar”?</h4>

<p>We were reassured that ES6 classes “<a href="http://ilikekillnerds.com/2015/02/a-guide-to-es6-classes/" rel="external" class="underline">are syntactic sugar over existing Javascript prototypical inheritance</a>”. This is true, up to a certain point, but there are important differences.</p>

<p>The first is that ES6 classes, unlike function constructors, are not hoisted. This is because the <em>extends</em> clause needs to be evaluated correctly, which hoisting would prevent.</p>

<p>If desired, in ES6 it is also possible to create subclasses out of built-in objects.</p>

<p>In the example below, the Error constructor is used to create an exception class:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
class MyError extends Error {};
throw new MyError('Something happened!');
</code>
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, transpilers like Babel are unable to replicate this feature.</p>

<p>Another point is that there is no need to declare ‘use strict’ within classes – the browser will presume this as a given and will evaluate the code accordingly.</p>

<p>Class names are given an immutable const declaration, but only within the class itself. This is a sensible approach towards helping to prevent errors. Indeed, there are a number of ES6 class features intended to prevent stupid coding mistakes.</p>

<h4>Classes that handle private data</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.2ality.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Dr Axel Rauschmayer</a> recommends using WeakMaps as a means of holding private data in a class, and gives this code example:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
let _counter = new WeakMap();
let _action = new WeakMap();
class Countdown {
    constructor(counter, action) {
        _counter.set(this, counter);
        _action.set(this, action);
    }
    dec() {
        let counter = _counter.get(this);
        if (counter < 1) return;
        counter--;
        _counter.set(this, counter);
        if (counter === 0) {
            _action.get(this)();
        }
    }
}
</code>
</pre>


<p>This approach is explained in detail in <a href="http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_maps-sets.html#sec_weakmaps-private-data" rel="external" class="underline">this section of this book</a>, ‘Exploring ES6’.</p>

<h4>Should ES6 classes be used?</h4>

<p>Some leading voices, such as <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/common-misconceptions-about-inheritance-in-javascript-d5d9bab29b0a" rel="external" class="underline">Eric Elliott</a>, caution against using classes. His argument is that “it’s an awkward fit for JavaScript”, which is “more restrictive… and obscures the very cool prototypal OO system that was built into the language a long time ago”.</p>

<p>Mozilla employer Ashley Williams has argued against classes too, with the reasons listed in this slide from a recent talk:</p>

</picture>
</p>
<p>As an experienced programming educator, she finds that abstraction hinders the learning process.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is true, but take a look at the following two code examples that demonstrate “<a href="http://es6-features.org/#ClassInheritance" rel="external" class="underline">OOP-style and boilerplate-free inheritance</a>”.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 5:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var Rectangle = function(id, x, y, width, height) {
    Shape.call(this, id, x, y);
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
};
Rectangle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
Rectangle.prototype.constructor = Rectangle;
var Circle = function(id, x, y, radius) {
    Shape.call(this, id, x, y);
    this.radius = radius;
};
Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle;
</code>
</pre>

<p>ECMAScript 6:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
class Rectangle extends Shape {
    constructor(id, x, y, width, height) {
        super(id, x, y);
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
}
class Circle extends Shape {
    constructor(id, x, y, radius) {
        super(id, x, y);
        this.radius = radius;
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>In my humble opinion, although ES6 classes do hide underlying functionality, the output is more readable than function constructors that are dependent on Function.prototype.call() and Function.prototype.apply() methods, as well as the liberal use of the prototype and constructor keywords.</p>

<p><a href="http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_classes.html#leanpub-auto-complaint-es6-classes-obscure-the-true-nature-of-javascript-inheritance" rel="external" class="underline">Axel Rauschmayer states</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_classes.html#leanpub-auto-complaint-es6-classes-obscure-the-true-nature-of-javascript-inheritance"><p>Yes, ES6 classes do obscure the true nature of JavaScript inheritance… But you can lead a comfortable life by simply taking ES6 classes at face value. I don’t think the illusion will ever bite you. Newcomers can get started more quickly and later read up on what goes on behind the scenes (after they are more comfortable with the language).</p></blockquote>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>If you do have reservations about the rightness of ES6 classes, I suggest that you set them aside. Although it will take years for browsers to fully implement ES6, the use of transpilers like Babel is becoming ubiquitous in the commercial environment. It’s a matter of when, rather than if, you start using ES6 classes. Take the time now to become familiar with them, and with the rest of the ES6 spec too.</p>

CSSconf EU, Berlin, 26 September 2015

CSS

<p>As JavaScript hurtles on like a Mercedes-Benz S-Class on the autobahn, CSS seems to be stuck in a slow-moving traffic jam. </p>

<p>Skimming the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#cats=CSS" rel="external" class="underline">Caniuse CSS list</a>, there aren’t many features that have been added since the last time I looked a year ago. Text-align-last, scroll snap points, exclusions, shapes, and interaction media features for media queries and variables all look interesting, but multi-browser support is appalling.</p>

<img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/logos/CSSconfEU-logo-2015.svg" alt="CSSconf EU logo" class="svg-container-right"  width="402" height="142">

<p>The most urgently required feature is <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=grids" rel="external" class="underline">CSS Grid Layout</a>, but rollout across the “browser-scape” is painfully slow.</p>

<p>Fortunately, preprocessor tools like SASS have allowed us to work with CSS more effectively, while our workflow has been shaped by methodologies like SMACK and BEM.</p>

<p>So, while we continue to face frustrations when working with CSS, a vibrant tooling ecosystem and best practices discussions help to push us on.</p>

<p>A conference like CSSconf EU acts as a forum where we can pool our knowledge together to formulate solutions, or even where we can be informed of previously unknown problems.</p>

</p>

<p>Any presentation that opens with a David Emery Black Panther print as the opening slide wins my undivided attention, and Claudina Sarahe, speaking in that awkward conference opening slot, did just that.</p>

<p>Claudina makes the positive argument that human agency drives technological change, stating: </p>

<blockquote><p>It’s the ability for collective participation and collective action that are really the necessary ingredients for change. Our tools have enabled us to try radical things, we are creating an environment in which people we can get things done, and we are doing this while being encouraging, supportive and welcoming.</p></blockquote>

<p>The speaker praised the community, which is based around open source projects and developer meetups and conferences, as well as the support and advice emanating from blogs, forums and social media.</p>

<p>Alluding to wider social forces, Claudina opined that we have much to offer other sectors: </p>

<blockquote><p>We are successful practising models of participatory culture. We may take this for granted, but it’s really incredible. Not everybody works this way.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Speaker #2 Una Kravets: Photoshop is Dead!: Editing Images in CSS</h4>

</p>

<p>Una is right in calling out Photoshop as bloated, expensive, slow software. Just as Dreamweaver was once the primary frontend IDE, Photoshop is heading down the same road to irrelevancy too.</p>

<p>The speaker advocated using style markup to design in the browser, and proceeded to use CSS for image manipulation in her live coding examples. The CSS she primarily used was background-blend-mode, mix-blend-mode and gradients.</p>

<p>Una keeps up a <a href="http://travels.surge.sh/" rel="external" class="underline">travel blog</a> where she experiments with new techniques. On the cutting edge, the website footer message reads: “Please note, this site works best in the latest version of Chrome (built in 44). I know. I don’t care.”</p>

<h4>Speaker #3 Michael Mifsud: It’s All Just Functions and Variables</h4>

</p>

<p>The bravest speaker of the day was Michael Mifsud, who live coded in C++.</p>

<p>Michael is the lead developer in the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/libsass" rel="external" class="underline">LibSass project</a>. This is a C/C++ implementation of the Sass compiler that, in friendly competition with Node.js and Ruby versions, aims to be the fastest of them all.</p>

<p>Although the speaker wasn’t green to programming before starting LibSass, he was new to C++, which makes the project’s achievements particularly impressive.</p>

<p>With his self-deprecating humour, he gave us two new initialisms: CPDD – copy/paste-driven development; and CEDD – compiler error-driven development.</p>

<p>But, past the jokes, he emphasised the commonality of programming fundamentals across languages: variables, functions and loops.</p>

<p>For Michael, this knowledge should be exploited to give us the confidence to tackle new, different projects.</p>

<p>Lea Verou, originally from the Greek island of Lesbos, has been a regular conference speaker for several years now and has become a familiar enough face to be given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lea_Verou" rel="external" class="underline">her own Wikipedia page</a>. She is currently a Research Assistant at MIT in the United States.</p>

<p>Lea is a master at live code presentations, and takes the audience on a journey that resembles a travel log. Her aim, in this talk, was to code a CSS-only pie chart. It’s not an easy endeavour, and some unusual CSS tricks were, at times, required.</p>

<p>Her talk finished with a plea to browser vendors to implement conic-gradient(), which has been listed in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css4-images/#conic-gradients" rel="external" class="underline">CSS Image Values and Replaced Content Module Level 4 document</a> since 2012.</p>

<h4>Speaker #6 Horia Dragomir: I Don’t Want to be on Facebook All Day</h4>

<p>Horia is a UI developer at Facebook who has been working on their recently released Messenger service.</p>

<p>As one would expect, Facebook Messenger is built with React, and much of Horia’s talk was explaining their approach to writing CSS. In particular, they are very keen on micro-optimisations – with a massive user base, saving individual bytes really does have an impact on the total bandwidth.</p>

<p>Facebook, like the rest of us, uses vendor prefixes in their CSS code; but, where they differ is by relying on user-agent sniffing (I presume) to ensure that only the right vendor prefixed CSS goes to the right browser (for example, no -ms- prefixes in the CSS that is used on Firefox or Chrome).</p>

<p>Horia was one of the few, if only, speakers of the day to emphasise the importance of accessibility in their work.</p>

<h4>Speaker #7 Glen Maddern: Interoperable CSS</h4>

<p>This talk was the most controversial of the day. We can sympathise about the problem – a lack of CSS modularity – but the audience were divided on Glen’s solution.</p>

<p>Before the conference, I had already heard about this technique, and it has now become a neologism: “Interoperable CSS”. In essence, it relies on using JavaScript as a build tool to enforce modularity; in particular, through the renaming of classes.</p>

<p>SASS with BEM are working well for me at the moment, and it would be easy to dismiss “Interoperable CSS” as an unnecessary, over-complicated solution; but, I’ll reserve judgement until I have used it in practice.</p>

<p>This talk was probably the most informative of the day. I have worked on a limited number of multilingual projects, but Katie, as a developer at Getty Images, has to handle dozens of language versions.</p>

<p>This appears to be a major headache. Here are some tips that I took away from her presentation:</p>

<p>We, in the English-speaking world, are familiar with following CSS unicode values for quotes:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
q {
quotes: '\201C' '\201D' '\2018' '\2019';
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>But in other languages, such as German, this would be incorrect.</p>

<p>Orphans and widows are (still!) a major problem, with no implementation in Firefox and Safari outside the use of paged media.</p>

<p>Avoid using text-transform due to unintentional misstyling in certain languages on certain browsers.</p>

<p>There was much, much more useful information provided by Katie, and I’m looking to forward watching her presentation again which is now hosted on YouTube.</p>

<h4>Speaker #11 Zoe M. Gillenwater: Enhancing Responsiveness with Flexbox</h4>

</p>

<p>I’ve used Flexbox on two projects and I’ve been distinctly unimpressed. Like the CSS animation module, it has the feel of “design by committee” and, being the subject of two previous major redrafts by the W3C CSS Working Group (WG), there were clearly serious disagreements about its implementation.</p>

<p>I’m not familiar with W3C CSS WG’s internal discussion, but I can speculate that differences arose from its ambitious scope. Its unintuitive feel is partly caused by its backwardly incompatible CSS syntax, with many properties – flex-flow, flex-grow, flex-shrink, etc. – and values, such as column-reverse and wrap-reverse, being newcomers to the CSS vocabulary.</p>

<p>I'm going to have to return to Flexbox for a third attempt. Frontend coders are going to need knowledge of this new layout module, and to assess when and where it should be used</p>

<p>In her talk, Zoe Gillenwater calls for the use of Flexbox as a means of enhancing the layout of certain page sections, rather than as a means of full page layout.</p>

<p>The slides for this talk are here:</p>

<p>I, too, concur on this. Well done to the organisers for providing top-quality food and making sure that the vegetarians and vegans among us were well provided for. And the coffee, which flowed in streams, was luscious.</p>

<h4>Diversity Tickets</h4>

<p>Many of us paid between 25% and 100% more on the regular ticket prices to allow the creation of a diversity slush fund. This enabled a number of individuals to attend who would have otherwise been financially excluded. As a note to the conference organisers, please can you coordinate some feedback from those that took advantage of this support? It would be interesting to read what their expectations were before the event, and what they took away from the conference.</p>

<p>Apologies to the last speaker of the day, Tim Holman. I had to leave early, so I missed your talk.</p>

Reject.JS conference, Berlin, 24 September 2015

JavaScript

<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> “Forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatans”</em></p>

<p>The ingredients list for the perfect Reject.JS cake is as eclectic as it is exotic. You’ll need: an experienced NYC teaching fellow; a Cognitive Science graduate (Honours thesis: “What’s so funny?: Investigating the time-course of lexical access in the processing of puns”); a specialist in online Japanese media; an award-winning pianist; a knitting hacker; and an academic in Computational Neuroscience.</p>

<img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/logos/rejectjs.svg" width="250" height="240" alt="rejectjs logo" class="svg-container-right">

<p>Then, throw in a few hundred frontend engineers and some buckets of JavaScript.</p>

<p>There were 11 speakers throughout the day, and lots of cake, coffee and chatter in between the talks.</p>

<p>Reject.JS was programming bliss, where the boundaries of genius, temerity and foresight were pushed to inspiring lengths.</p>

<p>Below is a quick summary of the highlights.</p>

<p>We were taught by <a href="http://thealphanerd.io/" rel="external" class="underline">Myles Borins</a> about the necessity of empathy, which, metaphorically, was an autobahn drive with signposts to Theresa Wisman, Brené Brown, Robert Vischer, Theodor Lipps, Edward Itchener and Giacomo Rizzolatti.</p>

<p><a href="http://jenna.is/" rel="external" class="underline">Jenna Zeigen</a> mused on the similarities between the human brain and the JavaScript programming language: we may hold syntax, semantics and pragmatics in common, but differ in morphology and phonology. And, yes, human beings are as bad at multitasking as JavaScript.</p>

<p>We were also told, by <a href="http://brooklynjs.com/" rel="external" class="underline">BrooklynJS</a> member <a href="http://kosamari.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Mariko Kosaka</a>, the tale of programming and knitting.</p>

<p>It takes a degree of ingenuity to weave together the intellectual strands of the mathematical odyssey that has led to today’s digital environment, and it takes a certain degree of madness to do so from the starting point of converting digital graphics into knitting patterns for an electric knitting machine. But Mariko, before demonstrating her own pattern generator parser, explored the roots of textile loom punch cards with a narrative that started far before the famous 20th century IBM punch cards and reached back into the previous century and the work of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Herman Hollerith and Joseph Marie Jacquard.</p>

<p>As Babbage wrote to his intellectual equal, Ada Lovelace: “Forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatans – everything in short but the Enchantress of Numbers”.</p>

<p>The subject of neuroscience may seem an odd fit for a presentation at a JavaScript conference, but <a href="https://twitter.com/robrkerr" rel="external" class="underline">Robert Kerr</a> did so in relation to his use of the D3 data visualisation library.</p>

<p>The point of Robert’s talk wasn’t to teach people the finer points of the Hodgkin–Huxley Model of the squid giant axon, but rather to demonstrate the optimal use of web technology for academic cooperation.</p>

<p>I didn’t leave with a greater understanding of what neurons actually do, but I did have a greater appreciation of the platforms being used to share research in neuroscience. For the speaker, browser-based technology combined with cloud storage permitted collaboration using JavaScript-generated 3D visualisations.</p>

<p>Mozilla employee <a href="http://ashleygwilliams.github.io/" rel="external" class="underline">Ashley Williams</a> used her experience in the education sector to provide a criticism of the features of ES6 far more eloquently than the linguistically challenged Eric Elliott and Douglas Crockford.</p>

<p>Her argument, coming from the perspective of an educator, would be different from mine, since I only face code in the studio, not in the classroom. Therefore, Ashley’s point of view was especially welcome.</p>

<p>Elsewhere at Reject.JS, we witnessed a ukulele player strumming with the Web Audio API, while another contributor used the Johnny-Five library to access C++ in the cause of robot dancing.</p>

<p>The theme of Reject.JS was the celebration of an interdisciplinary approach to programming.</p>

<p>And it was correct to follow this theme. It’s when we step out of our little box and away from coding for coding’s sake that we will, individually and collectively, excel.</p>

<p>Three examples from the past: hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, famous for his 60s “bob cut”, was directly inspired by the geometry associated with Bauhaus architecture; music mogul Tony Wilson spun New Order and the Happy Mondays to the world on an intellectual diet of avant-garde situationism; Sex Pistols swami Malcolm McLaren became high on fermenting cultural revolution after studying the 1780 Gordon Riots.</p>

<p>For the three listed above, they took inspiration outside their own industries to be used as ideas to disrupt (sorry!) their own.</p>

<p>Approximately 58.7% of the speakers at Reject.JS were women. I’ve stated it before and I’ll state it again: all the most beautiful dreams are destroyed by the egos of men, which is why women should rule the world. Well done to Reject.JS for taking us a step closer to a fabulous tomorrow of female leadership.</p>

<p>Shout it loud: <em>Reject.JS is dead! Long live Reject.JS! We are not afraid of the future!</em></p>


Please stop using faux constants in JavaScript

JavaScript

<p>It’s 2015, but I’m still seeing <em>faux</em> constants in JavaScript code like this:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var OUTCOME_TYPE = {
    aProperty: ‘some string’,
    anotherProperty: ‘another string’,
    yetAnotherProperty: ‘yet another string’
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>The all-caps style proclaims the use of a constant; except, in JavaScript, there used to be no such thing. The value passed to the variable OUTCOME_TYPE is configurable, writable and enumerable. The <em>faux</em> constant above is mutable – a constant should be immutable.</p>
<p>For years, all-caps were commonly used as a signifier of a constant. This became common practice despite leading JavaScript advocates such as Douglas Crockford cautioning against using such a style. In his document, ‘<a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html">Code Conventions for the JavaScript Programming Language</a>’, which was based, loosely, on ‘<a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/javacodeconventions.pdf">Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language</a>’, Crockford wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Global variables should be in all caps. (JavaScript does not have macros or constants, so there isn’t much point in using all caps to signify features that JavaScript doesn’t have.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why this advice was ignored can, perhaps, be explained by this contribution from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/14148/david-thornley">David Thorney</a> on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/777705">stack overflow</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>All caps is the traditional C designation of a preprocessor macro constant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This practice seeped into the dynamically typed JavaScript, becoming commonly employed by coders. </p>
<p>Today, there is no need for <em>faux</em> JavaScript constants – we can create real constants.</p>
<h4>ES6 constants</h4>
<p>The biggest problem with trying to use ES6 constants is patchy browser implementation – only Firefox and IE11 offer full support  (at least, according to kangax’s <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/">ES6 compatibility table</a>). </p>
<p>These are screenshots taken for Chrome 44 and Safari 8 using kangax’s ES6 browser support assessor: </p>

</p>

<p>Safari 9 beta 4 shows the same support for ES6 const as Safari 8, but WebKit nightly now has full support of ES6 constants</p>

<p>Safari here is falling behind; but with Chrome, as long as you use the ‘use strict’ string in your code, everything will be fine.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
const PI_ES6 = 3.141592
</code>
</pre>
<h5>ES5 constants</h5>
<p>If it is not possible to safely use ES6 constants, it is possible to create them using an ES5 object method:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
Object.defineProperty(typeof this === 'undefined' ? window : this, 'PI_ES5', {
    value: 3.141592,
    enumerable: true,
    writable: false,
    configurable: false
});
</code>
</pre>
<p>The above will work in all browsers IE9 and above. The big difference between ES5 and ES6 constants is that the latter can be <a href="http://www.2ality.com/2015/02/es6-scoping.html">block-scoped</a>.</p>
<h3>Functions as constants</h3>
<p>Could a constant be a function? Sure, why not. There’s no reason why constants should only be used for primitives. If the function serves as a reusable helper utility, then declaring it as a constant makes perfect sense: </p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
// ES6 constant
 const DATENOW_ES6 = function dateNow() {
    let now = new Date();
    now.setMilliseconds(null);
    now.setSeconds(null);
    return now;
};

// ES5 constant
Object.defineProperty(typeof this === 'undefined' ? window : this, 'DATENOW_ES5', {
    value: function dateNow() {
        var now = new Date();
        now.setMilliseconds(null);
        now.setSeconds(null);
        return now;
    },
    enumerable: true,
    writable: false,
    configurable: false
});
</code>
</pre>

Notes from the Edge Conference 2015: Progressive enhancement and other jazz

General

<p>On Saturday 27 June, the fifth <a href="https://edgeconf.com/2015-london/" rel="external" class="underline">Edge Conference</a> took place in London at the Facebook HQ.</p>

<p>What initially spiked my interest in the event were <a href="https://edgeconf.com/2015-london/schedule" rel="external" class="underline">the four main discussion topics</a>: security, frontend data, components and modules, and progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>These are all solid debating points that are of interest to frontend developers fighting in the trenches. What I didn’t anticipate was the attendees, both speaking from the platform and embedded in the audience, who were a who’s who of coding glitterati. The presence of these faces added a welcome, qualified viewpoint in the informal breakouts.</p>

<p>On one of the hottest days of the year, I walked into the lair of the Facebook <em>datenkraken</em> and instantly found myself sweating profusely; but this wasn’t a psychical manifestation of being in the belly of the Forces of Darkness – rather, it was because the silly buggers hadn’t turned the air conditioning on.</p>

<p>The day was broken into two sections. The morning consisted of presentations and discussions in the central room, while the afternoon schedule was based on breakouts on the four main topics (plus a few more, such as SASS and CSS patterns and using Service Workers).</p>

<p>Of the panel sessions, the discussion from the floor was muted. This was, I feel, for two reasons. The first was that even seasoned contributors were a little apprehensive about offering opinion in such a pressurised open-plan environment of 200 plus uber-developers – particularly as their contribution was going to be broadcast live across the net. The other, and perhaps the biggest reason, was the choice of backchannel software: Slack. This hindered rather than assisted the debate.</p>

<p>Note to conference organisers: <em>Slack is the worst choice of software to use for the backchannel discussion</em>. The rapid growth of user-generated comments to the Slack channels formed into a disjointed, disharmonious discourse akin to a William Burroughs cut ’n’ paste drug-fuelled montage. To follow both the ongoing conference debate and the backchannel was impossible.</p>

<p>As noted in Satya van Heummen’s dissection of Slack’s appeal, ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@satyavh/the-real-reason-slack-became-a-billion-dollar-company-f14c22b15a29" rel="external" class="underline">The REAL reason Slack became a billion dollar company</a>’:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://medium.com/@satyavh/the-real-reason-slack-became-a-billion-dollar-company-f14c22b15a29"><p>Slack is just another stream (or streams, if you have more than 1 channel) of continuous information that you have to follow. I remembered I found it distractive and stressful because it was so easy to miss out on stuff.</p></blockquote>

<p>The destructive nature of Slack has already been noted by other write-ups on the Edge Conference:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://robinosborne.co.uk/2015/07/06/edgeconf-2015-provoking-thoughts/"><p>During the day the slack channels were moving so rapidly that I often found myself engrossed in that discussion instead of the panel up in front of us.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://labs.ft.com/2015/07/edge-5-here-we-go-again/"><p>Slack went totally bananas for large parts of some of the breakout sessions, and some of it got too disjointed from what the panel was saying.</p></blockquote>

<p>As for the content of both the panel discussions and connected breakouts, the numerous blog posts and Twitter spats that appeared in the following week bear witness to its usefulness to the wider confab on web technologies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for so many of the topics, it was <em>plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose</em>.</p>

<h3>Frontend data</h3>

<p class="image-container">

</p>

<p>With his opening intro, <a href="http://nolanlawson.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Nolan Lawson</a> certainly wowed the throng with slick examples of frontend data in use today. If the topic ended the moment Lawson resumed his seat, we would have all walked away converts: eager to utilise the myriad of new browser data APIs.</p>

<p>But then the discussion started.</p>

<p>The choices for browser data storage and access APIs are overwhelming, with the conclusion that using a reputable library is the recommended way of achieving cross-browser consistency. As one audience participant commented on the current confusing array of options: “This sucks right now.”</p>

<p>But, as Mozilla’s <a href="http://tofumatt.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Matt MacPherson</a> noted about one key library: “I like localForage and it is very useful but it is a very simple key value store and it’s full of race conditions.” The mere mention of “race conditions” will send any respectable developer running to the hills in terror.</p>

<p>IndexedDB came in for a hammering as being too low-level and impractical for everyday use. “It’s just too painful,” one panel member stated. Browsers still can’t guarantee persistent data retention and, what’s worse, there is no browser API that gives developers warning of cyclical browser cache wiping.</p>

<p>Afterwards, a fellow attendee turned around and commented to me: “That discussion was a bit weird. It seems like we haven’t moved on over the last four or five years.”

<h3>Components and modules</h3>

</p>

<p>Fitting in the React library, native web components and ES6 modules was too broad for a single session, but over the course of the panel and subsequent breakout it was clear that native web components had promised much, but delivered little.</p>

<p>Google was the frontrunner for pushing web components as the brave new future world, including heavy promotion of their <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/" rel="external" class="underline">Polymer library</a>; but browser vendors have diverged in their interpretation of the correct implementation of this spec.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki" rel="external" class="underline">The Gold Standard Checklist for Web Components</a>, a project initiated by <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/" rel="external" class="underline">Jan Miksovsky</a> to help in creating “web components that aspire to be as predictable, flexible, reliable, and useful as the standard HTML elements”, is brain-achingly complex. If there is need to spell out correct standards to this level of detail, then the potential for erroneous code is enormous. </p>

<p>In the breakout session, <a href="http://christianheilmann.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Chris Heilmann</a> asked whether we are now at a stage similar to that of the DOM and jQuery 10 years ago. Then, the DOM API was such a travesty that using a library was the only sensible solution.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in 2015, there is little point in attempting to write native browser web components. Panel speaker <a href="http://ianfeather.co.uk/" rel="external" class="underline">Ian Feather</a> said:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have these libraries that are available; custom elements are available right now and people can build things with them, but very few people are. At the moment, all the examples come from Google event pages, Polymer pages. When you research web components online, there is a plethora of information: reams and reams and books and books of information and talking, and very little feedback on use – very little of people saying, ‘I’ve tried this; this didn’t work’. <em>We need to push so that we can get a V1 out so that we can get feedback and get people involved in it and get people using it. Just ship something.</em> [My emphasis.]</p></blockquote>

<h3>Progressive enhancement</h3>

</p>

<p>This discussion seems more essential today than ever. Many of us are so immersed in agile methodology, tooling and keeping up with hyperfast browser API rollouts that we put our own processes ahead of the user experience.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement is the art of defining the lowest common denominator for basic user support, and then layering mark-up and script on top of this base for more advanced platforms.</p>

<p>The central pillar of this debate is defining just what the baseline is.</p>

<p>If we were to follow the advice of <a href="https://adactio.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Jeremy Keith</a> and the representatives of Opera Mini, then we would all be coding to 1998 standards <em>in perpetuum</em>, while other voices in the discussion are more forgiving.</p>

<p>In recent times, those who have been shouting loudest on this subject have been the development teams from the BBC and GOV.UK and, although their work is commendable, as public services their remit is to reach 100% of all web users. This is an atypical industry brief. Due to time and budget restraints, most of us have to set baseline support which falls short of every browser on every device.</p>

<p>The thick-client trend of monolithic JavaScript frameworks (AngularJS, Ember, etc.) that has taken hold of the industry in recent years is ripe for takedown. We have become too dependent on JavaScript for essential website functionality, which is problematic as JavaScript is probably the least dependable part of the web stack. The DOM API is lousy, and mobile web users are victim to insanely inconsistent connection speeds and latency time.</p>

<p>JavaScript, in the form of Node.js, is an ideal choice for middleware, but I have serious doubts about its suitability in a client-side MV* framework (after working on a number of large-scale e-commerce projects). Isomorphic JavaScript, which renders on both server and client-side, has come under fire for fixing a problem that shouldn’t have been created in the first place.

<p>Watch this short video of an alcohol-fuelled conversation (<a href="https://xkcd.com/323/" rel="external" class="underline">Ballmer Peak</a>) between Jake Archibald and Paul Lewis, entitled ‘HTTP203: Progressive Loading’:</p>

<p class="video-container">
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/miLnRHNj7nQ?list=PLOU2XLYxmsII_38oWcnQzXs9K9HKBMg-e" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>Here are the concluding remarks:</p>

<p>Archibald:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miLnRHNj7nQ&index=2&list=PLOU2XLYxmsII_38oWcnQzXs9K9HKBMg-e "><p>To be fair to frameworks, I do like how they are starting to go with this server-rendering approach. What do you call this, Isomorphic? It feels like the right approach. It’s a band aid over the problem of slowing everything down.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lewis:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miLnRHNj7nQ&index=2&list=PLOU2XLYxmsII_38oWcnQzXs9K9HKBMg-e "><p>They made this problem. This whole thing was avoidable if they just did what we did. By leveraging good caching, first render stuff, Service Worker, your performance problems are solved.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, now we have the spectacle of Google representatives on a YouTube channel offering best practices advice to web developers, rebutting the approach of well-supported Google project AngualrJS. Great going, guys. Confusion ahoy!</p>

The London-based technology industry: present and future

<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong>London is now the centre of the European technology sector; but three issues threaten its future: rent rises, Britain's relationship with the EU and repressive government digital surveillance laws.</em></p>

<p>I’ve been a contractor working in the web-based technology industry in London for several years now. Most contracts I undertake last in the region of six months. My current contract, with Sainsbury’s Entertainment, which finishes in mid-July, will have been for a total of nine months — my longest contract so far.</p>

<p>Most web-orientated companies are based in the area stretching from Farringdon to Shoreditch, with an expansion of this particular industrial sector occurring in recent years. In many ways, like attracts like: experienced, clever programmers are attracted to the area because of the quality and quantity of jobs; this, in turn, attracts companies to this part of London, eager to recruit these talented employees; this, then, attracts more developers from across the globe, and so on.</p>

<p>This widening circle of expansion means that this relatively small geographical area has become the centre of the technology industry for the UK, if not the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of my short-term employment, I’ve worked in a wide spectrum of companies in London’s large technology sector. Below are some thoughts on the characteristics of its multinational workforce and three areas of concern that could lead to the demise of this entire sector in the UK capital.</p>

<h3>The Tower of Babel</h3>

<p>I’m London born and bred, but it’s stimulating to be part of a diverse workforce. This is fortunate considering the majority of the labour pool originates from outside the UK. Always curious-minded, I often instigate conversations about people’s backgrounds, probing into the cultural and societal differences in their respective countries compared to England.</p>

<p>Of the developers I have worked with, nearly all are in their twenties to thirties. The regions they come from are mostly Eastern Europe (particularly Poland and Romania), Southern Europe, the Indian subcontinent and, increasingly, from France and South America.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are lots of programmers from Germany, Holland and Scandinavia in London, but not nearly as many as from other parts of the world. I suspect that is due to the work opportunities available in these regions compared to the aforementioned list of other areas of the world.</p>

<p>Of the many young developers I have spoken to there are two, almost universal, characteristics about their outlook.</p>

<p>The first is that the UK starts and ends in London. They may have taken the occasional weekend trip outside the capital, but they are quite likely to have spent years in London without having properly explored the country outside its gigantic metropolis.</p>

<p>Secondly, they have a very deep and genuine disinterest in local societal, political and historical issues. Indeed, they fail to even see the local society and history in which they live and work. What they experience is a cacophony of races and languages: a Year Zero of urban modernity bereft of any historical continuity.</p>

<p>The entire area of London that hosts today’s technology sector has deep historical foundations; scratch the surface and you will find the stories that lie beneath — the 1384 Peasants’ Revolt, the English Civil War, the plague pits, the porters at Smithfield meat market marching against immigration in 1969. However, just bringing up these subjects with my international co-workers elicits, within seconds, a glazed-eyes response. They don’t care.</p>

<p>This outlook is, like the Irish before them, typical of first-generation immigrants. Their perspective is shaped by a notion of impermanence: that they are here for a relatively short period of time to work, and then they will return home.</p>

<p>As for their London-centric travel limits, fitting for those with one foot elsewhere, they are more likely to use their holidays to return to their country of origin than explore the hinterlands of this island.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that they are ignorant; they are all highly educated individuals who are interested in political and social issues, but these tend to be of an international nature, for example the environment or the recent leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>

<p>Still, this is London, and unlike other cities, you don’t have to be born here to be a native — you just have to move here to become a Londoner.</p>

<h3>The London technology sector: whither are we bound?</h3>

<p>The first rule of capitalism is nothing stays still, not even for a second; if something isn’t growing, it is dying.</p>

<p>Currently, the London technology sector is expanding. Its plateau and subsequent decline is inevitable, although it’s hard to forecast when this will occur.</p>

<p>There are three big issues that will have a direct impact on its future.</p>

<h4>Rent rises</h4>

<p>The rising cost of housing and office space is unsustainable. The point will be reached where, for both employers and employees alike, London will become unattractively unaffordable. Any sane government would introduce private and commercial rent controls in order to stabilise these brutish hikes; however, as so many governmental participants are themselves a part of the private and commercial landlord setup, there is an obvious self-interest in the short-term gain that the rent money brings.</p>

<p>Of note, successive British governments have, for decades, demonstrated a total disinterest in long-term planning.</p>

<h4>Our relationship with the EU</h4>

<p>Our current government is committed to holding an in/out referendum on European Union (EU) membership. This will likely occur in 2017. The uncertainty up until 2017 will have an influence on commerce in London, with the aftermath of a vote to leave the EU having even more.</p>

<h4>Repressive government digital surveillance laws</h4>

<p>Ever since the Edward Snowden leaks, there has been heightened concern in technology circles about privacy.</p>

<p>Let’s make this clear: with a few exceptions, nobody in the civil service or the political class has ever given a damn about the rights of the British people to privacy (unless it is their right to privacy).</p>

<p>They are completely open about their opinions on this subject, as demonstrated by this <a href="http://www.grahamlanktree.com/blog/privacy-not-an-absolute-right-says-former-gchq-boss" rel="external" class="underline">quote from Sir David Omand</a>, director of the UK’s signals intelligence agency GCHQ from 1996–97: “privacy is not an absolute right — it’s a qualified right”.</p>

<p>In May, the government announced a ‘turbo-charged’ version of the snooper’s charter.</p>

<p>There has been an alarmist reaction in technology circles to this news:</p>

<p>The full details of the revived Data Communications Bill have yet to be released, but technology companies, already severely stung by the criticism of their previous cooperation with Western intelligence agencies, are now extremely sensitive to this issue. They are unlikely to meekly acquiesce to an expansion of government surveillance.</p>

<p>Britain already has a reputation in tech circles for having the most unaccountable, intrusive secret service apparatus in the Western world. Tech companies may take this opportunity to regain some credibility on this issue by taking a very public stand against the British government, ultimately threatening to vote with their feet.</p>

<p>Personally, I’m prepared to fight on all these issues. At the same time, however, I’m making escape plans so that I can leave the UK and become an immigrant in somebody else’s city.</p>

<p>If you are based in London and are involved in the technology industry and you are not doing the same, then you are a fool.</p>

Using the WebP image format

Responsive Design

<p>Created and developed by Google, <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/?csw=1" class="underline" rel="external">WebP</a> is an image format comparable to JPEGs but smaller in size. Despite being released under the permissive BSD open source licence, no other browser vendor has implemented WebP, and nor are they likely to.</p>

<p>The key benefit, Google claims, of using WebP over other web image formats is the smaller file sizes which:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/?csw=1"><p>are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25–34% smaller in size compared to JPEG images at equivalent SSIM index. WebP supports lossless transparency (also known as alpha channel) with just 22% additional bytes. Transparency is also supported with lossy compression and typically provides 3x smaller file sizes compared to PNG when lossy compression is acceptable for the red/green/blue color channels.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the spring of 2013, <a href="http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/mozilla-takes-a-fresh-look-at-googles-webp-image-format/" class="underline" rel="external">Mozilla announced that they were considering adding support for WebP in Firefox</a>.</p>

<p>The connected <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c19" class="underline" rel="external">debate on the bugzilla tracker</a> ran for months and months, with support and rejection viewpoints appearing in equal measure; so it’s unlikely WebP browser support will be widened beyond its current browser base.</p>

<p>A lot of the comments on the bugzilla tracker are very technical, but below are some highlights for a general readership:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c136"><p>I’m head developer and system admin of http://www.memecenter.com I want to share our experience with WebP. It’s a fairly big website with more than 150 million pageviews/month. We have a young audience so Chrome usage is really high:
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c136"><p>Last month’s browser distribution:
 (taken from Google Analytics):<br>
Chrome 59.53%<br>
Firefox 20.02%<br>
Safari 6.81%<br>
IE 4.55%.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c136"><p>We have implemented WebP back in February 2013. Currently there are more than 8 million images both in jpeg and WebP. We are still using UA sniffing for detecting WebP support, but will soon convert it to accept headers. As our user base heavily uses Chrome, we’ve seen huge bandwidth savings and pages are loading a lot faster. We even use seperate CSS for WebP to use WebP images in CSS. The only downside so far is user’s bad experience while they try to save images to their computer or share with their friends.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c136"><p>As disk space [is] usually a magnitude cheaper than bandwidth, it’s never been an issue for us. When progressive decoding lands, we will most probably encode in that format as only 3–4% of chrome users fall behind the latest version. We’ll always use jpeg fallback for those who does not support latest version of WebP.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c136"><p>If Mozilla implements WebP we’ll have more than 80% of users supporting WebP format, and it will reduce bandwidth costs even more. (Not to mention page speed.)</p></blockquote>

<p>---------------</p>

<blockquote cite="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c190"><p>At Netflix we re-encoded hundreds of thousands if not a million images in WebP without hand curation with success. Our customers seem pretty happy.</p></blockquote>

<p>---------------</p>

<blockquote cite="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c192"><p>The whole point is that WebP is only a reasonable solution for closed systems. People keep bringing up Netflix while ignoring the fact that Netflix still relies on Silverlight. Netflix can do whatever it wants because their material doesn’t have to interoperate with any other website or software. Facebook trialed WebP but their users rejected it because they could not share the images with friends using browsers incapable of dealing with WebP images.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c192"><p>Adding WebP would add yet another defacto-nonstandard-standard to the mix. Daala (the current working name of a new image format: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daala">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daala</a>) being years away from being ready is why it has a real chance of gaining any acceptance. Even VP9 and HVEC are both going to struggle for any adoption given the dominance of H.264 and the same is true for WebP vs Jpeg and PNG. It’s like Beta vs VHS or Blu-Ray vs HD-DVD: you are battling over features and specs in a war of market forces.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c192"><p>To force Apple and IE to accept any new standard requires overwhelming force, something we have no hope of kindling until the next major standards/technological refresh. We might as well save our resources for when we have a chance at winning.</p></blockquote>

<p>---------------</p>

<blockquote cite="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c180"><p>Personally I’m more inclined to focus my efforts in improving WebP and take advantage of its features (the 2048 color cache for instance) rather than hacking old image formats (mozjpeg seriously? what is it going to produce, a free version of JPEGmini? Rather foster arithmetic encoded JPEG and here you got your 8% improvement in a snap, turn arithmetic coding to Huffman on the fly when users save their images if you are afraid users can’t open them elsewhere)</p></blockquote>

<p>---------------</p>

<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375#c174" class="underline" rel="external">This comment by Josh Aas</a>, Senior Technology Strategist at Mozilla Corporation, neatly summarises the arguments against the implementation of WebP in Firefox. I’ll state it even more succinctly: WebP will never be supported in any browser other than Chrome and Opera.</p>

<p>But, as these two browsers alone have over 40% share of the desktop browser market share, it is worth exploring whether WebP can be used in a web build to help reduce page size.</p>

<h4>WebP configuration</h4>

<p>
Images can be converted into WebP using either the command line, or as part of the workflow using a Grunt or Gulp plugin. I choose <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-webp-compress" class="underline" rel="external">grunt-webp-compress</a>, but there are several other options - including, even, <a href="http://telegraphics.com.au/sw/product/WebPFormat#webpformat" class="underline" rel="external">a Photoshop plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Image conversion to WebP has several optional parameters, which I’ll return to in another post, after fully familiarising myself with this codec’s complexity.</p>

<p>This post is concerned with the practicalities of WebP implementation, not with fine-tuning the format for optimal quality and size.</p>

<p>After using grunt-webp-compress, <a href="https://github.com/TCotton/portfolio/tree/master/app/images" class="underline" rel="external">the WebP versions are now viewable side-by-side with the original PNG/JPEGs on my GitHub account</a>.</p>

<h4>Embedding WebP in the page using the picture element</h4>

<p>The HTML picture element now has over <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=picture" class="underline" rel="external">41% browser support</a>. I’ve used the picture element - together with the source, srcset and sizes attributes - on several web builds and, I’m happy to state, it is a celebratory achievement of how collaborative work between browser vendors can succeed. </p>

<p>The new responsive image HTML syntax is complicated enough to handle the variety of scenarios that device diversity throws at us, but not so complicated that it gives developers the rope to hang themselves with if wrongly used.</p>

<p>One attribute, type, allows mimetype to be declared as a value. This is perfect for choosing a WebP image with a PNG or JPEG fallback.</p>

<p>Here is the most basic example I can think of:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>

&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://example.co.uk/images/cute-kitten.webp&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://example.co.uk/images/cute-kitten.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This is a picture of a cute kitten&quot; with=&#x201d;400&#x201d;&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

</code>
</pre>

<p>Browsers that support WebP will display that version of the image, while the rest will use JPEG.</p>

<h4>Using WebP for background images in CSS</h4>

<p>This was my first attempt at using WebP in CSS:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>

.project-box-one {
    background-image: url(‘/images/elevaate-work.png’);
    background-image: -webkit-image-set(url(‘/images/elevaate-work.png.webp’) 1x);
  }

</code>
</pre>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how well Chrome handles this code. Rather than downloading both images, then displaying WebP according to the cascade rule, it only downloads and renders the image declared in the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-image-set" class="underline" rel="external">-webkit-image-set function</a>.</p>

<p>And I would have got away with it, if it wasn’t for that pesky Safari browser!
Safari/Webkit supports -webkit-image-set, but not WebP, so neither the PNG nor the WebP image were displayed in that browser.</p>

<p>My second attempt was to use CSS3 <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=supports" class="underline" rel="external">@supports</a>:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>

.project-box-one {
    background-image: url(‘/images/elevaate-work.png’);
    @supports (background-image: -webkit-image-set(url(‘/images/elevaate-work.png.webp’) 1x)) {
      background-image: -webkit-image-set(url(‘/images/elevaate-work.png.webp’) 1x)
    }
  }
}

</code>
</pre>

<p>Now all browsers display the correct image appropriate to their level of support; but, as Safari has yet to implement CSS3 @supports, one can cannot presume that the code above will work as hoped for when they finally do.</p>

<p>My third and final attempt at safely using WebP in CSS relied on Modernizr:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">

<p>Now it works fine across all browsers.</p>

<p>I used to be very hostile towards using dynamically-generated classes in my CSS, but it’s common practice when using a frontend MV* framework, and the above approach is, to me at least, completely acceptable.</p>

<p>In a future blog post, I will detail the WebP configuration options with the aim of finding the right balance between quality and size.</p>

Angular 1.x, ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and testing with Karma and PhantomJS

AngularJS

<p>In July 2008, JavaScript godfather Brendan Eich announced ECMAScript Harmony, taking as its starting point elements of the failed ECMAScript 4 initiative.</p>

<p>The first specification draft was published in July 2011, with the final version expected in the summer of 2015.</p>

<p>Interest in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) has been growing, as this Google Trends graph demonstrates:</p>

  </p>

<p>There is considerable excitement on social media about ES6; it is being welcomed as a critical leap forward for this popular programming language.</p>

<p>Frontend coders are no longer "fluffers", but are considered engineers in the driving seat of the web build.</p>

<p>Mainly due to the popularity of frontend MVC frameworks, JavaScript is now employed at scale in corporate environments. The stated motivation behind ES6 was to ease the pain often experienced when using JavaScript on large projects; this helps explain the high level of enthusiasm about its release.</p>

<p>Implementation of ES6 in the major browsers has been patchy, with Mozilla Firefox showing the most readiness to push ahead and Safari/Webkit the least.

<h4>ES6 to ES5 compilers</h4>

<p>To allow developers to jump straight into the ES6 play pit, compilers have become a popular way of refactoring code into ECMAScript 5 (ES5), allowing code written in ES6 to run in all common evergreen and legacy browsers.</p>

<p>The two most popular compilers are <a href="https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler" rel="external" class="underline">Traceur</a> and <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="external" class="underline">Babel</a>, which have 64% and 76% ES6 coverage, respectively.</p>

<h4>Angular and ES6</h4>

<p>The wholesale adoption of ES6 by <a href="https://angular.io/"rel="external" class="underline">Angular 2.x</a> has been discussed <em>ad nauseam</em>. Some eager developers have been exploring ways of using ES6 with Angular 1.x, with two articles of note being '<a href="http://blog.thoughtram.io/angularjs/es6/2015/01/23/exploring-angular-1.3-using-es6.html" rel="external" class="underline">Using ES6 with Angular today</a>' by <a href="https://twitter.com/cburgdorf" rel="external" class="underline">Christoph Burgdorf</a>, and '<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/writing-angularjs-apps-using-es6/" rel="external" class="underline">Writing AngularJS Apps Using ES6</a>' by <a href="http://sravi-kiran.blogspot.co.uk/" rel="external" class="underline">Ravi Kiran</a>.</p>

<p>However, if you are not concerned with supporting the legacy browsers, then perhaps using a compiler for a production build is unnecessary. It may be the case that you are building an internal company tool whereby all users are equipped with an evergreen browser, or you may be working on a personal project such as a portfolio, where your intention is to demonstrate your grasp of modern frontend technology.</p>

<p>An alternative to a compiler is to access only the small set of ES6 features currently rolled out in stable browsers.</p>

<p>ES6 is a big beast to tackle in one bite - in a couple of years' time, we’ll be writing JavaScript that barely resembles the language commonly produced today. Using only a small set of ES6 features as a means to gradually introduce yourself to the full specification is a sensible tactic. Also, you may be inheriting a project already near or at completion, so refactoring into ES6 may not be the wisest choice.
</p>

<p>Don’t forget to consider the performance implications of code produced by a compiler. Mike Horen in '<a href="https://coderwall.com/p/ey0j_w/es6-tranceur-vs-standard-javascript-performance" rel="external" class="underline">ES6 Traceur vs Standard Javascript Performance</a>' claims that performance is slowed by a factor of two, and as much as six if using block binding (“let” instead of “var”). Jon Kuperman investigates Traceur’s handling of block scoping in '<a href="http://jonkuperman.com/transpiled-javascript-performance/" rel="external" class="underline">Transpiled JavaScript Performance</a>', declaring:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://jonkuperman.com/transpiled-javascript-performance/"><p>It seems as though Traceur’s compilation of this feature can really wreak havoc on the performance of your code.</p></blockquote>

<p>I would like to see more research into this subject. Code created by Traceur and Babel is noticeably verbose, and in an era where web performance is of paramount concern, I hope that tools created for one solution don’t succeed at the expense of creating another problem.
</p>

<h4>Karma testing suite and ES6</h4>

<p>If you do adopt a “native browser features only” approach, you will walk into a brick wall if you are using <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html" rel="external" class="underline">Karma</a> for unit testing; this is the case, at least, if you are using Karma with the headless browser, <a href="http://phantomjs.org/" rel="external" class="underline">PhantomJS</a>. This is because PhantomJS uses an older version of Webkit for its engine. Code that works natively in stable browsers will fall flat on its face when processed by these testing tools.</p>

<p>However, there is an easy solution: install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-babel" rel="external" class="underline">grunt-babel</a> (or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-babel" rel="external" class="underline">gulp-babel</a>). In your Gruntfile.js, declare which files you would like transpiled and in which folder they should be placed. This folder should be considered a temporary repository and not included in your Git build. As long as you are pointing to the ES5-friendly versions of your files in your test settings, you can use ES6 with Karma/PhantomJS without any problems.
</p>

<p>I asked my work colleague to follow the steps above; I was suspicious because rarely do any cutting-edge tools in web development work without first treading on a path of pain. However, he was also as impressed as I was. </p>

<h4>ES6 without a compiler</h4>

<p>Within six months, the incorporation of ES6 features by the evergreen browsers will have expanded from their current base (hopefully that will include the slow adopters Safari/Webkit). Instead of reliance on a transpiler, partial use of ES6 will be an attractive proposition for developers. Thankfully, with such an active community, solutions can be found to the different approaches available when adapting to the new ES6 landscape.</p>

Using Web Workers with AngularJS

AngularJS

<p>Inspired by Gleb Bahmutov’s article ‘<a href="http://bahmutov.calepin.co/run-angular-digest-cycle-in-web-worker.html" class="underline" rel="external">Run Angular Digest Cycle in Web Worker</a>’, I experimented to see if I, too, could use Web Workers with AngularJS.</p>

<p>As I’m sure you are aware, JavaScript is single-threaded: all code is queued and executed in a sequence.</p>

<p>Using Web Workers, we can run JavaScript processes concurrently (or at least, as close to concurrently as this language allows). The primary benefit of this approach is to handle the manipulation of data in background threads without interfering with the user-interface.</p>

<p>The use of Web Workers is rarely required in regular web builds. Although we can use them for image manipulation in the browser, it would be preferential to do this server-side. They are invaluable when required, however</p>

<p>Eighteen months ago, I created a side project called <a href="http://lightning.gs/" class="underline" rel="external">lightning.gs</a>. This created Data URIs from uploaded images, optimising PNGs in the process; the latter was achieved through a JavaScript port of Pngcrush. Without Web Workers, it would be impossible to attempt image optimisation in the browser; the user’s page would freeze under the weight of computationally intensive code.</p>

<p>The implementation of Web Workers with Angular is achieved through using promises, and looks like:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>

webWorkerFS.f('createContentSnippetFooter', [storyContent]).then(function(contentSnip) {
    content.dir(contentSnip);
});

</code>
</pre>

<p>The function takes two parameters: the name of the function in the dedicated Web Worker, and an array of data to be passed for manipulation.</p>

<p>To assist with correct implementation, a few error messages are included in the event of incorrect function parameters being passed:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>

angular.module('webWorkerFunctionService', []).factory('webWorkerFS', ['$q', function($q) {

    'use strict';

    var _getWorker;

    _getWorker = function _getWorker(functionName, functionParams) {};

    return {

        f: function f(functionName, functionParams) {

            if (arguments.length < 2) {
                throw new TypeError('Not enough arguments. ' +
                    'The first param is a function name as string. ' +
                    'The second is an array of data types');
            }

            if (typeof arguments[0] !== 'string') {
                throw new TypeError('First parameter must be a string. ' +
                    'This is the name of the function');
            }

            if (!Array.isArray(arguments[1])) {
                throw new TypeError('Second parameter must be an array. ' +
                    'This is an array of data to be processed');
            }

            return _getWorker(functionName, functionParams);
        }
    };
}]);

</code>
</pre>

<p>In the private _getWorker function, a dedicated worker is spawned and given a constructor name:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>

_getWorker = function _getWorker(functionName, functionParams) {

    var deferred;
    var myWorker = new Worker('shared/functionWebWorker.js');

    deferred = $q.defer();

    myWorker.onmessage = function onmessage(oEvent) {
        deferred.resolve(oEvent.data);
    };

    myWorker.postMessage({
        'functionName': functionName,
        'functionArgs': Array.prototype.slice.call(functionParams)
    });

    return deferred.promise;
};

</code>
</pre>

<p>Being passed to the Web Worker, in this instance, are the function name and the function arguments. Array.prototype.slice.call is a well-used means of converting an object to an array.</p>

<p>In the functionWebWorker.js, the onmessage handler carries out more validation, calling the required function.</p>

<p>The ever-useful apply calls the function with the global object and an array of arguments.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>

onmessage = function onmessage(oEvent) {

    if (oEvent.data instanceof Object &&
        oEvent.data.hasOwnProperty('functionName') &&
        oEvent.data.hasOwnProperty('functionArgs')) {

        functionsObject[oEvent.data.functionName].apply(self, oEvent.data.functionArgs);

    }
};

</code>
</pre>

<p>The functionsObject consists of functions as parameters:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>

var functionsObject = {

    createContentSnippetFooter: function createContentSnippetFooter(title) {

        // to create a codeSnippet cut down the content to around 130 characters without cutting a whole word in half
        var snippet, maxLength, trimmedString;

        //strip any HTML tags
        snippet = title.replace(/(<([^>]+)>)/ig, '').trim();

        // maximum number of characters to extract
        maxLength = 260;

        //trim the string to the maximum length
        trimmedString = snippet.substr(0, maxLength);

        //re-trim if we are in the middle of a word
        postMessage('"' + trimmedString.substr(0, Math.min(trimmedString.length, trimmedString.lastIndexOf(' '))) + ' ...' + ' "');

    }
};

</code>
</pre>

<p>Using Web Workers to remove HTML and cut a string down to a set number of characters is a trivial example, but the purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate that Web Workers can be integrated into your Angular build in a resourceful manner. The code is intended as a versatile way to expand the functions in the dedicated Web Worker without the need to refactor the service.</p>

<p>Testing proved more of a challenge. Used in the above context, the Jasmine spyOn method was required in the beforeEach function:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>

var webWorkerFS = _webWorkerFS_;
deferred = $q.defer();
deferred.resolve(contentSnippet);
spyOn(webWorkerFS, 'f').and.returnValue(deferred.promise);

it('Tests the _createContentSnippet() function. Must be 270 or fewer characters, to contain an ellipse and finish with double quotes', function() {

    var result;

    webWorkerFS.f('createContentSnippetFooter', [newsBlurResponse.stories[0]['story_content']]).then(function(returnFromPromise) {
        result = returnFromPromise;
    });

    $rootScope.$apply(); // promises are resolved/dispatched only on next $digest cycle

    expect(result).toBe(contentSnippet);
    expect(scope.recArticle.content.length).toBeLessThan(270);
    expect(scope.recArticle.content).toContain('...');
    expect(scope.recArticle.content).toMatch(/["]$/);
});

</code>

2015: The End of the Monolithic JavaScript Framework

JavaScript

<p><em><strong>tl;dr</strong>: We need to move beyond monolithic frameworks to a component/library-based front-end solution, but there’s too much fragmentation/abstraction to create an industry standard approach. Below are some constructive thoughts aimed at building a more viable and stable alternative.</em></p>

<p>Arguably, the front-end layer of the web stack has, in recent years, seen a greater pace of change than any other.</p>

<p>This has been led, primarily, by an aggressively ambitious feature expansion roadmap by the four major competing browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>It is no coincidence that the era of front-end permanent revolution only came about after Internet Explorer’s monopoly was smashed by the arrival of Chrome in 2008.</p>

<h4>JavaScript</h4>

<p>The front-end code troika are CSS, HTML and JavaScript; the latter is most subject to incessant change. For years, JavaScript languished in stasis. During the last decade, the only major development was the adoption of AJAX that uses the XMLHttpRequest object for client–server communication, but this originated in a browser feature first introduced in Internet Explorer 5.</p>

<p>Since then, the pace of JavaScript expansion has increased in two different ways.</p>

<p>In 2009 the overseeing standards body, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International" rel="external" class="underline">Ecma International</a>, introduced their first new version, <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/" rel="external" class="underline">ECMAScript 5</a>, in over ten years. This was quickly followed by ECMAScript 6, currently <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/" rel="external" class="underline">partially implemented in the evergreen browsers</a> and due to be finalised sometime in 2015. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4PVbLpUIdzoUjdmSkFtVVozQnM/view" rel="external" class="underline">Public discussion has already begun on ECMAScript 7</a>.</p>

<p>The second area of expansion comes under the catch-all banner of HTML5. There is now a multitude of new APIs to utilise. I have used, at some point over the last 12 months, the following: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications" rel="external" class="underline">File API</a>; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader" rel="external" class="underline">FileReader API</a>; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Using_full_screen_mode" rel="external" class="underline">Full Screen API</a>; <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/dom-access-control-using-cors/" rel="external" class="underline">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a>; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/User_experience/Using_the_Page_Visibility_API" rel="external" class="underline">Page Visibility</a>; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/basic_usage" rel="external" class="underline">Web Workers</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64.atob" rel="external" class="underline">Base64 encoding and decoding</a>. There are dozens more in existence, all with varying degrees of browser support.</p>

<h4>JavaScript Frameworks</h4>

<p>Harnessing the power of contemporary JavaScript has seen arrival of the model–view–controller (MVC) JavaScript framework. The MVC architectural pattern for these frameworks is interpreted far more loosely than server-side MVC frameworks, with all variants commonly abbreviated to MV*.</p>

<p>The first framework to be widely commercially used was <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" rel="external" class="underline">Backbone.js</a>. Created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jashkenas" rel="external" class="underline">Jeremy Ashkenas</a>, who also authored <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" rel="external" class="underline">CoffeeScript</a>, its initial public release came in the autumn of 2010.</p>

<p>Here are some positive Twitter reactions from the succeeding 12 months:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Reading up on Backbone.js (http://goo.gl/fELo) and Underscore.js (http://goo.gl/f3VC) makes me wanna be a front-end developer.

<p>Backbone.js was the first but its meta-framework approach left space for a newer generation of full-frameworks - the most notable being <a href="http://emberjs.com/"rel="external" class="underline">Ember.js</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org/" rel="external" class="underline">AngularJS</a> - to gain rapid traction among developers, as these positive tweets testify:</p>

<p>Today, AngularJS’s popularity far exceeds that of any other framework, although Ember.js has a healthy, vibrant community of contributors and users. I suspect, 2015 will witness an increase in Ember’s popularity due to the controversial Angular roadmap.</p>

<p>AngularJS, commonly referred to as just Angular, was originally conceived by <a href="https://github.com/abrons?tab=repositories" rel="external" class="underline">Adam Abrons</a> and <a href="http://misko.hevery.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Miško Hevery</a>; the latter continued the project at Google. More programmers were added freely as it grew in both project scope and popularity.</p>

<p><a href="http://jaxenter.com/deep-dive-into-web-architecture-103268.html" rel="external" class="underline">In this interview from 2011, Miško explains how he views the Angular approach to building single-page applications:</a></p>

<blockquote cite="http://jaxenter.com/deep-dive-into-web-architecture-103268.html"><p>Angular in a way acts as a polyfill or a shim to give the browser the vocabulary which is useful for building web-applications.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://jaxenter.com/deep-dive-into-web-architecture-103268.html"><p>A lot of what a web-application code must do is DOM manipulation to present the data to the user. DOM manipulation code is around 80% of application code. Angular lets you declare the way the internal state (model) is projected to the DOM, which means that your application code can skip writing the DOM manipulation code, and having to write 80% of code is a huge saving. The result is that an application written with Angular is significantly shorter, and as a result easier to maintain.</p></blockquote>

<p>Generally speaking, compared to Backbone, far fewer lines of code are written when using Angular; although depending on the complexity of the project, this doesn’t necessarily mean less development time. Although all the main JavaScript (JS) frameworks have many similarities, Angular differs from the rest in its use of dirty checking, an in-depth description of which can be <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope" rel="external" class="underline">read in the official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Angular dates back to 2009 but the vast majority of Angular developers have only been using the framework over the last couple of years. Originally conceived as a means to assist non-web developers with creating applications, its complexity means it is a tool for seasoned developers only.</p>

<p>One noticeable unintentional consequence of the rise of the front-end framework is an influx of server-side programmers to the front-end. These programmers bring with them, I would argue, more hardened approaches to the web build, especially in the areas of test-driven development (TDD) and design patterns (although they do have some annoying habits like insisting on using Twitter Bootstrap).</p>

<p>This isn’t an article detailing Angular’s strengths and weaknesses, but when a giant news publication such as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/" rel="external" class="underline">The Guardian</a> switches to Angular, it’s clearly a sign of a mature project that is able to scale to the most demanding of commercial environments.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Angular team <a href="http://jaxenter.com/angular-2-0-112094.html" rel="external" class="underline">went public with their plans for AngularJS 2.0</a>. This important version will be a complete rewrite of the codebase, with no backwards compatibility to the 1.x line of releases.</p>

<p>With important new browser features like Web Components just around the corner, the Angular team felt that this was the only option open to them. Such a revolutionary roadmap elicited many hostile responses, with the quotes below taken from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2kl88s/angular_20_drastically_different/" rel="external" class="underline">Reddit thread</a>. A lot of the comments are unnecessarily dramatic due to a misunderstanding of the rationale behind the planned changes, but those highlighting a lack of backwards compatibility in a corporate environment are right to be concerned:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2kl88s/angular_20_drastically_different/clmi8px"><p>This is a mess. The syntax looks like hot shit, and the huge gap between this and 1.3 means those of us with real jobs where projects live for years and years have to back off. I can’t tell my boss that we’re going to build something incredible, but that we need to plan for a code only, no new features rewrite in 18 months.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2kl88s/angular_20_drastically_different/clmkvex"><p>I work for a moderately large company (2,000 people) and were rolling out a new web experience to replace all our old text based systems this weekend. I've backed angular the whole way and its been lovely to work with - the entire UI is written in it. This news is incredibly unfortunate, inconvenient and potentially expensive.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2kl88s/angular_20_drastically_different/clmkvex"><p>The old systems have been running for over 15 years without breaking version to version, and even survived a Solaris to Linux migration. Meanwhile I can't even get a year out of an app before it's superseded with no migration path. Unreal.></p></blockquote>

<p>Regardless of your opinion of Angular 2.0 (and there are many good reasons why it should be completely rewritten), this episode has highlighted the dangers of investing time and resources into a single monolithic framework with corporate stewardship. Google’s leadership of the project has led to dozens of full-time developers being deployed on the project, but Google is a business with its own unique set of requirements; it would be hard to think of a non-Google-based open software project that considers <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/" rel="external" class="underline">Dart</a> important enough to create a new language, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YUzC-1d0V1-Q3V0fQ7KSit97HnZoKVygDxpWzEYW0U/mobilebasic?viewopt=127&pli=1" rel="external" class="underline">AtScript</a>, which compiles into both JavaScript and Dart.</p>

<p>This is the fatal point of weakness inherent in the one-stop solution. Facing the prospect of learning - from scratch - a new front-end framework (which is what, according to current plans, Angular 2.0 will be), some voices have openly expressed weariness at the permanent revolution being forced on front-end developers.</p>

<p>In London, companies are dependent on contract labour. In 2013–2014, it was almost impossible to recruit seasoned Angular developers, but the recruitment landscape has become slightly more amenable in recent months.</p>

<p>When Angular 2.0 is finally launched, companies will once again face the strenuous task of recruiting candidates who can work within the new framework.</p>

<p>Jimmy Breck-McKye penned an article, <a href="http://www.breck-mckye.com/blog/2014/12/the-state-of-javascript-in-2015/" rel="external" class="underline"><em>The State of JavaScript in 2015</em></a>, in the closing weeks of 2014:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.breck-mckye.com/blog/2014/12/the-state-of-javascript-in-2015/"><p>Innovation is great, but this kind of churn rate seems excessive. It’s just not possible for developers to make large, upfront investments of time in getting to grips with new frameworks and technologies when there’s no guarantee of their longevity. Programmers want to program – they want to build things, and be masters of their craft. But how can we get anything done when we’re spending most of our time learning? How can we feel like craftsmen when we’re scrabbling in the dark with unfamiliar tech?</p></blockquote>

<p>One solution presented by Jimmy was to “Prefer dedicated libraries to monolithic frameworks” because:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.breck-mckye.com/blog/2014/12/the-state-of-javascript-in-2015/"><p>When you choose a framework, you make a large, long term commitment. You sign up to learn about the framework’s various inner workings and strange behaviours. You also sign up to a period of ineffectiveness whilst you’re getting to grips with things. If the framework turns out to be the wrong bet, you lose a lot. But if you pick and choose from libraries, you can afford to replace one part of your front end stack whilst retaining the rest.</p></blockquote>

<p>Joe Gregorio’s well-read article, <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/2014/05/zero_framework_manifesto" rel="external" class="underline"><em>No more JS frameworks</em></a>, contributed to the debate on full-framework over reliance. And it is from Joe that I take the phrase ‘zero framework manifesto’.</p>

<h4>Building a Zero Framework Manifesto</h4>

<p>Combining several different non-proprietary software licensed projects mitigates the possibility of reliance on one multi-purpose framework. If a component is discontinued or the direction of the roadmap is radically changed, that project could, with relative ease, be replaced with another similar non-proprietary software project.</p>

<p>There are, though, several dangers to this approach.</p>

<p>The first is of agency/corporate siloing. With so many front-end open source/free projects to choose from, each development house could be building their own tailored framework. To a certain extent, this is favourable, but too much diversity - and in particular, abstraction - will affect the ability to recruit, retain and train staff.</p>

<p>Another issue is maintainability. Rather than code coming from one trusted source, the use of multiple projects would require constant code reviewing with each new release.</p>

<p>If a component-based approach is widely adopted, the industry needs to subscribe to a manifesto of common purpose. Below are some ideas.</p>

<p><strong>1. Corporations need to give and not just take.</strong></p>

<p>Today, non-proprietary software is the backbone of every layer of the web stack in the majority of corporate IT departments. One major issue facing all these projects is that corporate users are quick to magpie the software released under a permissive BSD, MIT or Apache License 2.0 licence, and then fail to contribute, in turn, any modified code back, or to even share their gained knowledge through blog posts or talks. Legally, under these licences, that is their entitlement; ethically, they are in the wrong. Permissive legal licences, such as those listed above, allow open source software to be interpreted as “free beer”, damaging the fragile cooperative ecosystem that sustains them.</p>

<p>Either companies need to have a serious ethical rethink or we should abandon permissive legal licences, using the GPL licence to force code-sharing. This is, as far as I understand, the fundamental dividing line that Richard Stallman claims makes free software different from open software.</p>

<p><strong>2. Avoid over-abstraction.</strong></p>

<p>Through simplicity comes great power and maintainability. Simplicity, in the framework of this article’s discussion, means adhering to the JavaScript spec as standardised by Ecma International. <a href="https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html" rel="external" class="underline">This is the draft of version 6</a>.</p>

<p>There has been a trend towards creating JavaScript subset languages that transcompile on runtime to browser-friendly JS.</p>

<p>React uses JSX to allow that framework to be accessible to “casual developers such as designers”. Angular 2.0 will use ATScript which transcompiles into both JS and Dart. CoffeeScript offers only syntactic changes - little more than putting lipstick on a pig. The most interesting of them all is TypeScript, which offers features common to other programming languages but that are absent from JavaScript: types, classes and interfaces.</p>

<p>Three of the four listed above were conceived and are maintained by three large web-based corporations, initially for internal use but then released under licence to all developers.</p>

<p>With ES6 just around the corner, the attraction of using JS subsets has become less alluring.</p>

<p><strong>3. Use <a href="http://isomorphic.net/" rel="external" class="underline">Isomorphic JavaScript</a>.</strong></p>

<p>There needs to be a dual server-side and client-side solution to enable razor-sharp performance. If you are unconvinced that performance doesn’t matter in 2015, then I would encourage you to read <a href="http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2013/slow-pages-damage-perception/" rel="external" class="underline"><em>Slow Pages Damage How Users Perceive Your Content, Design, and Navigation</em></a> by <a href="http://www.webperformancetoday.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Tammy Everts</a>.</p>

<p><strong>4. A clear separation of concerns.</strong></p>

<p>Having grown used to Angular’s extensive use of logic in the template, it now seems far more natural than initially indicated by my initial shock when first seeing inline JavaScript during my Angular introductory days. Like any platform, one adapts and makes the best use of a feature, but keeping logic out of the view should be a priority.</p>

<p><strong>5. No dependencies.</strong></p>

<p>Any choice of third-party libraries must be standalone and not dependent on another library (although there is a difference between “plays nicely with” to “this requires the use of”).<p>

<p><strong>6. Using an ES6 compiler.</strong></p>

<p>Personally, I’m uncomfortable with using an ES6 to ES5 compiler like <a href="https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler" rel="external" class="underline">Traceur</a> or <a href="https://6to5.org/" rel="external" class="underline">6to5</a>. These are ‘black boxes’ that swallow code in one end and spit a different version out the other; if the aim, however, is to avoid using JS subsets, then writing in standard-compliant ES6, which is then changed to standard-compliant ES5, is in the scope of the manifesto.</p>

<p>I’m waiting for an opportunity to embrace Traceur or 6to5 on a forthcoming project before I can properly evaluate them.</p>

<h4>Some Library Suggestions</h4>

<p>The list below comprises recipe parts pointing towards a fully baked solution; it is the equivalent of me going through the cupboards and fridge and placing the ingredients I like the most onto the table. Subscribing to the maxim of “absolute criticism of all things existing”, I don’t uncritically endorse any single one of these projects, but they are good starting points for initial investigation.</p>

<h5>Templating</h5>

<p><a href="http://mustache.github.io/" rel="external" class="underline"><strong>Mustache</strong></a>: quite possibly the most popular “logic-less” templating system in current use.</p>

<h5>Micro-Frameworks</h5>

<p>It may be worth considering using a micro-framework as a starting point:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/young-steveo/bottlejs" rel="external" class="underline"><strong>bottlejs</strong></a>: “BottleJS is a tiny yet powerful dependency injection container. It features lazy loading, middleware hooks, decorators and a clean api inspired by the AngularJS Module API and the simple PHP library Pimple”.</p>

<p><a href="http://hay.github.io/stapes/#top" rel="external" class="underline"><strong>Stapes.js</strong></a>: a tiny MVC framework. From looking at GitHub submits, it hasn’t received much attention over the past year.</p>

<p><a href="http://somajs.github.io/somajs/site/" rel="external" class="underline"><strong>soma.js</strong></a>: “soma.js is a set of tools and design patterns to build a long term architecture that are decoupled and easily testable. The tools provided by the framework are dependency injection, observer pattern, mediator pattern, facade pattern, command pattern, OOP utilities and a DOM manipulation template engine as an optional plugin”.</p>

<p><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" rel="external" class="underline"><strong>knockout</strong></a>: the most popular, well-maintained of all those in this list, but one that is focused on the UI interface, using the Model View ViewModel architectural pattern.</p>

<p>The above is not an exhaustive list; I haven’t even covered TDD or Web Components.</p>

<h4>Follow the Way of the Zero Framework Manifesto</h4>

<p>It’s not merely enough to collate your own personal preferences into one system; there needs to be an industry-wide approach to an industry-wide problem.</p>

<p>Here are some questions you can ask when choosing a library:</p>

<p>
* How maintainable will this project be? If somebody else inherited your code tomorrow after you were run over by a bus, how quickly could they master your code?<br />
* Do any of the individual components adversely affect performance? If so, do they do so unnecessarily? Can this be changed by a pull-request/fork?<br />
* Do any of the components adversely affect accessibility? Can these be fixed by pull-requests/forking?<br />
* How open are the developer(s) of the components to code contributions? How quick are they to respond to queries in their GitHub connected issues section? Running an open/free software project can be extremely time-consuming, and although many start out with the best of intentions, most quickly become burnt-out and disillusioned.<br />
</p>

<p>To recap: write JavaScript, not somebody else’s interpretation of what Jav

CSS-only animated mobile menu

CSS

<p>Animated mobile menus are difficult to get right. It's a challenge to create a menu that keeps to the target 60 frames per second (fps). The consequence of failing to do this is a poor user experience.</p>

<p>Having a main menu that has smooth animation instead of inconsistent stuttering is an absolute necessity. In the trade, we call this ‘jank free’.</p>

<p>Before you start coding, you will need to arm yourself with the knowledge of which CSS to use for performance-friendly animation, and which CSS to avoid.</p>

<p>A Google employee and leading performance-focused web developer, Paul Irish, has written and lectured extensively on this subject.</p>

<p>In ‘<a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2012/why-moving-elements-with-translate-is-better-than-posabs-topleft/" rel="external" class="underline">Why Moving Elements With Translate() Is Better Than Pos:abs Top/left</a>’, Paul states:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.paulirish.com/2012/why-moving-elements-with-translate-is-better-than-posabs-topleft"><p>The top/left has very large time to paint each frame, which results in a choppier transition. All the CSS including some big box shadows, are computed on the CPU and composited against that gradient backdrop every frame. The translate version, on the other hand, gets the laptop element elevated onto it’s <em>[sic]</em> own layer on the GPU (called a RenderLayer). Now that it sits on its own layer, any 2D transform, 3D transform, or opacity changes can happen purely on the GPU which will stay extremely fast and still get us quick frame rates.</p></blockquote>

<p>He expands on the same subject in his article ‘<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations" rel="external" class="underline">High Performance Animations</a>’, whitelisting four CSS items: transform: translate(npx, npx); transform: scale(npx); transform: rotate (npx); and opacity:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations"><p>When you change elements, the browser may need to do a layout, which involves calculating the geometry (position and size) of all the elements affected by the change. If you change one element, the geometry of other elements may need to be recalculated. For example, if you change the width of the <html> element any of its children may be affected. Due to the way elements overflow and affect one another, changes further down the tree can sometimes result in layout calculations all the way back up to the top.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The larger the tree of visible elements, the longer it takes to perform layout calculations, so you must take pains to avoid animating properties that trigger layout.</p></blockquote>

<p>Make sure you read his article for the complete list of CSS to avoid.</p>

<h4>Using the CSS checkbox hack</h4>

<p>This technique has been practiced for years. It’s a hack where into the mix you throw  a standard HTML form checkbox with CSS3, namely, the general sibling combinator and the ':checked' state of input.</p>

<p>Just by using relatively simple markup and styling code, it’s possible to create visually impressive, user-activated website features.</p>

<p>I've used the checkbox hack with animation on the mobile menu for this site, and I used exactly the same technique on a website I recently coded for a commercial job. Aesthetically, it's very pleasing to the eye and it even put a smile on the face of my client when I demonstrated it to him.</p>

<p>The HTML is as follows:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;label for="toggle-1" class="handheld-cross hidden-desktop"&gtMain Menu&lt;/label&gt
<!-- toggle checked box on page load or click of menu item -->
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="toggle-1"&gt

&lt;div id="navigation-wrapper"&gt

  &lt;ul class="navigation"&gt
    &lt;li&gt
      &lt;a href="/#!/work-projects" data-link="work-projects"&gtWork Projects&lt;/a&gt
    &lt;/li&gt
    &lt;li&gt
      &lt;a href="/#!/side-projects" data-link="side-projects"&gtSide Projects&lt;/a&gt
    &lt;/li&gt
    &lt;li&gt
      &lt;a href="/#!/about-me" data-link="about-me"&gtAbout Me&lt;/a&gt
    &lt;/li&gt
    &lt;li&gt
      &lt;a href="/#!/contact-me" data-link="contant-me"&gtContact Me&lt;/a&gt
    &lt;/li&gt
    &lt;li&gt
      &lt;a href="/#!/blog/" data-link="blog/"&gtBlog&lt;/a&gt
    &lt;/li&gt
  &lt;/ul&gt

&lt;/div&gt
<!-- end navigation -->
</code>
</pre>

<p>As demonstrated above, the hack only requires basic HTML.</p>

<p>This can be used alongside the CSS that enables user interactivity: CSS3 &lsquo;:checked&rsquo; and the general sibling combinator.</p>

<p>With the third CSS specification, CSS3, came a whole bunch of much welcomed code for exclusive use on forms. We are still far from having the ability to fully control the style of all form elements in all browsers, but the ‘web standards’ body has made great strides in this direction.</p>

<p>CSS3 also gave us an extra combinator in addition to CSS 2.1’s descendant &lsquo;ul li a&rsquo;, child 'ul > li > a', and adjacent siblings 'ul + li + a'.
The general sibling selector 'ul ~ li ~ a' matches the subsequent element in the selector list only if it is preceded by the first in the DOM, with both sharing a common parent.</p>

<p>General sibling selectors, like their CSS2.1 close relatives, allow for greater precision when targeting page elements.</p>

<p>The general sibling creates an inactive menu state:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
input[type=checkbox] ~ #navigation-wrapper li {
    // code here;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>With the addition of ':checked', it becomes an active menu state:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
input[type=checkbox]:checked ~ #navigation-wrapper li {
    // code here;
}
</code>
</pre>

<h4>Choosing the right CSS for positioning</h4>

<p>As promoted by Paul Irish, positioning of a page element is best achieved by using the transform property’s 'translate' function.</p>

<p>The inactive state positions the menu off the screen and to the left. Using a percentage value means that whatever the width of the menu it will always be positioned outside the screen area:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
input[type=checkbox] ~ #navigation-wrapper li {
    -webkit-transform: translateX(-200%);
    transform: translateX(-200%);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p class="image-container">
  <img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/image-one-hidden-menu.jpg" width="813" height="250" alt="">
</p>

<p>With the checkbox checked, the menu directly underneath can be repositioned into the centre of the page:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
input[type=checkbox] ~ #navigation-wrapper li {
    -webkit-transform: translateX(0%);
    transform: translateX(0%);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p class="image-container">
  <img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/image-two-display-menu.jpg" width="811" height="347" alt="">
</p>

<h4>Choosing the right CSS for animation</h4>

<p>The menu has two different states: invisible and visible.</p>

<p>Adding animation is the key to bridging these two opposing states.</p>

<p>Here are the keyframes:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
@keyframes swipeIn {
    from {
        transform: translateX(-200%);
    }

    to {
        transform: translateX(0%);
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Instead of animating all list items equally, it's better to stagger them with a delay that increases 100 milliseconds per item. The ‘:nth-child()’ selector allows for targeting individual list items, and with the aid of a ‘SASS loop’, a small amount of code can be written rather than a lengthy CSS block.</p>

<pre class="language-scss">
<code>
$percentage: 5;

// loops through the navigation list items to create delay staggered animation
@for $i from 1 through $percentage {
  input[type=checkbox]:checked ~ #navigation-wrapper li:nth-child(#{$i * 1}) {
    -webkit-animation: swipeIn 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.09, 0.68, 0, 0.99) #{0.1 + ($i / 10)}s;
    -webkit-animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    animation: swipeIn 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.09, 0.68, 0, 0.99) #{0.1 + ($i / 10)}s;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Above is the ‘for loop’ with the number of list items declared as a value of the $percentage variable. The maths after the ‘cubic-bezier’ function creates the 100 millisecond difference between each list item:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
#header input[type=checkbox]:checked ~ #navigation-wrapper li:nth-child(1) {
    -webkit-animation: swipeIn 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.09, 0.68, 0, 0.99) 0.2s;
    -webkit-animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    animation: swipeIn 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.09, 0.68, 0, 0.99) 0.2s;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}

#header input[type=checkbox]:checked ~ #navigation-wrapper li:nth-child(2) {

</pre>

<p>With animation, the checkbox-hack used on the menu now looks like this:</p>

<p class="video-container">
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ckk87uvJNp8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<h4>Hack for older Android devices</h4>

<p>Due to a well-publicised Webkit bug, the general selector combinator will only work correctly in the most recent Android versions.</p>

<p>A Stack Overflow member created a bug fix for this by forcing a repaint:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
@-webkit-keyframes bugfix {
    from {
        margin: 0;
    }

    to {
        margin: 0;
    }
}

body {
    -webkit-animation: bugfix infinite 1s;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>It may appear that after tiptoeing carefully across a minefield, I am now stomping on top of any performance concerns by promoting this bugfix, but I’ve fully tested the code with Google devtools and I can confidently state that there is only a small impact on memory and framerate. Nevertheless, I wrapped it in a media query that limits its use by deploying a ‘vendor-prefixed’ retina property, and have also limited its use within the browser width that the mobile menu targets:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
@media (max-width: 979px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {

    body {
        -webkit-animation: bugfix infinite 1s;
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Use CSS3 feature detection to block the bugfix in the latest Android and Chrome browsers:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
@media (max-width: 979px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {
    body {
        -webkit-animation: bugfix infinite 1s;
    }
}

@supports (-webkit-animation-name: bugfix) {
    body {
        -webkit-animation: none;
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<h4>The final part of the CSS</h4>

<p>The list div container, ‘#navigation-wrapper’, is positioned directly underneath the checkbox with a full width and a transparent background:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
#navigation-wrapper {
    position: absolute;
    top: 70px;
    left: 0;
    z-index: 10;
    background: transparent;
    width: 100%;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>When the list items are positioned off the screen, the div wrapper is still present &ndash; although invisible to the eye. If there are links or mouse-based events in the content directly underneath, this wrapper will block access to them.</p>

<p>This can be fixed by giving the container a pointer-events value of ‘none’, and the list items a pointer-events value of ‘auto’. Pointer-events are a useful, recent addition to the CSS canon. For a full explanation, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events" rel="external" class="underline">read the pointer-events Mozilla page</a>.</p>

<p>Use the checkbox label to attach an icon and hide the checkbox. There are many ways to achieve this:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
input[type=checkbox] {
    position: absolute;
    top: -9999px;
    left: -9999px;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>I used a background image on the label selector to give it a three-stripe menu icon.</p>

<p>I would recommend adding 'menu' as text above the icon. Icons always fare badly in usability tests, and although we web-savvy coders are familiar with the ubiquitous mobile menu icon, most web users are confused by its meaning.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The above code will work in all browsers apart from Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) and below. I don't consider it necessary to provide responsive design support to legacy browsers because an insignificant number of mobile users will be using IE9 or below to access the web.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting technique that is open to a lot of experimentation. I, for one, will keep coming back to it.</p>

Using CSS to style those notoriously tricky form elements: checkboxes and select dropdowns

CSS

<p>Designers really love pushing the envelope when it comes to forms. I’m not sure why forms, in particular, should be subject to such intensive attention. Perhaps it’s because, even in the tight design confines of a business website, forms have fewer formal restrictions on their layout and appearance.</p>

<p>Or maybe it’s because, on many websites, they are a critical feature—an important ‘call to action’. For A/B testing, forms offer us an easily quantifiable measurement: if we change this and we change that; are we receiving more responses or fewer?</p>

<p>The problem that we coders have with forms is not the designs, but browser restrictions that prevent us from bringing to life the lovingly crafted Photoshop files.</p>

<p>Unique among all website features, browsers enforce their own user interface first, before that of the individual website design. Although this is unfortunate, it’s not actually as simple as that. The restrictions vary from browser to browser, and for each different form element. </p>

<p>This leaves us in the worst possible scenario: we are following unwritten, inconsistent, nonsensical web standards. The browser vendors trip over themselves to deliver opinions on video codec support or the right markup for responsive images, but somehow forms have slipped through the cracks. They are good at defining markup rules - for instance, HTML5 input types - but bad at standardising styling.</p>

<p>For a long time, there have been various jQuery plugins that allow greater CSS control of forms, but these come at a price. And that price is trashed HTML.</p>

<p>I take HTML markup seriously. I aim to write code that validates and follows accessibility guidelines. I will not allow third-party JavaScript plugins to do as they see fit to the HTML in order to achieve their goals. I want it to look pretty, but not at any cost.</p>

<p>In the future, Web Components and the Shadow DOM will give us the control we seek; in the meantime, we are left with various hacks and tricks from the coders ‘Make Shit Happen’ book.</p>

<h4>Select dropdowns</h4>

<p>Here’s the design that we are going to turn into a coded website component:</p>

<p class="image-container">
  <img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/image-one-finished-select-dropdown-list.jpg" width="499" height="100" alt="">
</p>

<p>Here’s the markup for a simple dropdown list as <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/forms/controls#select" rel="external" class="underline">taken from the WebAIM website</a>: </p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
<label for="favcity">Choose your favourite city?</label>
<select id="favcity" name="select">
  <option value="1">Amsterdam</option>
  <option value="2">Buenos Aires</option>
  <option value="3">Delhi</option>
  <option value="4">Hong Kong</option>
  <option value="5">London</option>
</select>
</code>
</pre>

<p>This needs to change if we are going to design the above image, so in order to gain better control of the form element, we’ll wrap the ‘label’ around the ‘select’:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
<label for="favcity">
  <select id="favcity" name="select">
    <option value="0">Choose your favourite city</option>
    <option value="1">Amsterdam</option>
    <option value="2">Buenos Aires</option>
    <option value="3">Delhi</option>
    <option value="4">Hong Kong</option>
    <option value="5">London
    </optio>
  </select>
</label>
</code>
</pre>

<p>Tabbing through a form with Mac VoiceOver enabled seems okay for a ‘select’ list coded as above. It reads “Choose your favourite city” and then moves onto the next form element.</p>

<p>If, however, you don’t consider that this markup sufficiently meets accessibility standards, then there is an alternative that would work equally as well with the CSS in this article:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
<div class="favcity-wrapper">
  <label for="favcity" class="visuallyhidden">Choose your favourite city</label>
  <select id="favcity" name="select">
    <option value="0" aria-hidden>Choose your favourite city</option>
    <option value="1">Amsterdam</option>
    <option value="2">Buenos Aires</option>
    <option value="3">Delhi</option>
    <option value="4">Hong Kong</option>
    <option value="5">London
    </optio>
  </select>
</div>
</code>
</pre>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
/*
* Hide only visually, but have it available for screenreaders: h5bp.com/v
*/
.visuallyhidden {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>(Caution! <a href="http://community.sitepoint.com/t/screen-readers-labels-and-dropdown-lists/96784/10?u=divisive_cotton" rel="external" class="underline">The always reliable Stomme Poes warns against using the aria-hidden attribute on the Sitepoint forums</a>)</p>

<h4>Applying CSS to the dropdown</h4>

<p>Ideally, we would be able to nuke the native user interface (UI) in the reset, building our five story structure on the clean slate.</p>

<p>About half of <a href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/normalize.css" rel="external" class="underline">normalise.css reset</a> is concerned with creating a cross-browser level playing field for forms:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
/**
 * 1. Correct color not being inherited.
 *    Known issue: affects color of disabled elements.
 * 2. Correct font properties not being inherited.
 * 3. Address margins set differently in Firefox 4+, Safari, and Chrome.
 */

button,
input,
optgroup,
select,
textarea {
  color: inherit; /* 1 */
  font: inherit; /* 2 */
  margin: 0; /* 3 */
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Going one step further than normalize.css, let’s apply CSS ‘appearance:none’:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
select {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  -moz-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
  border-radius: 0;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is widely used, but it shouldn’t be. Once part of the CSS3 specification, it has since been dropped. Perhaps it might appear in another guise in future W3C documents, as <a href="http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css4-ui#dropped-css3-features">the author of the CSS Working Group Wiki muses</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The System Appearance feature, including the appearance property, was in the 2004 CSS3-UI CR but never implemented as designed. It likely needs a complete rethink and redesign, perhaps even a reframing/reexploration of the problems it was designed to solve.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In practice, ‘appearance:none’ is occasionally required in some UAs [(User Agent Strings)] (like Gecko, WebKit) to turn off the native rendering of some controls and allow full CSS styling.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Some form of ‘appearance:none’ may be worth exploring as a CSS4-UI feature.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Safari and Chrome, ‘appearance:none’ totally removes the grey, drab arrow icon, but in Firefox and Internet Explorer (IE), this still remains.</p>

<p class="image-container">
  <img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/image-two-chrome-select-dropdown-appearance-none.jpg" width="499" height="100" alt="">
</p>

<p class="image-container">
  <img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/image-three-firefox-select-dropdown-appearance-none.jpg" width="498" height="102" alt="">
</p>

<p>IE 10 and 11 have their own set of proprietary CSS for styling forms. You can read Jonathan Sampson’s article <a href="http://sampsonblog.com/615/ie10s-pseudo-elements" rel="external" class="underline">‘Designing with Pseudo Elements in IE10’</a>  for further details.</p>

<p>Let’s add some basic CSS for borders and padding:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
label[for=favcity] {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  width: 400px;
}

label[for=favcity] select {
  border: 5px solid #eeeeee;
  background: white;
  padding: 7px 20px 7px 20px;
  width: 100%;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: monospace;
  cursor: pointer;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now, let’s turn our attention to the children of ‘select’: ‘option’.</p>

<p>So extreme are the browser inconsistencies, I’m convinced that ‘option’ exists in a digital ‘twilight zone’. Firefox, Safari and IE11 will use the font-family chosen for ‘select’, Chrome, IE10 and IE9 use a browser-defined default.</p>

<p>Firefox reacts to margin and padding changes, but no other browser does.</p>

<p>No browser allows the styling of the border. And, while Chrome has a gentle box-shadow, IE uses a dirty, dark, thick border that scares little children caught unawares.</p>

<p>Android and iOS devices use the UI specific to the devices’ operating system (OS). Of those I’ve seen, most are competent, and some are very impressive.</p>

<p>IE9 throws in its own unique, evil twist by not expanding to the full width:</p>

<p class="image-container">
  <img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/image-four-ie9-select-dropdown-option.jpg" width="500" height="201" alt="">
</p>

<p>The best way of adding a dropdown arrow icon is to use pseudo-elements:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
label[for=favcity] {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  width: 400px;
}
label[for=favcity]::after {
  content: ' ';
  position: absolute;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
  width: 40px;
  height: 100%;
  display: block;
  background: #24d7ea;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The double colons are intentional. This is what prevents IE8 from using the pseudo-element design. Don’t even think of trying to style form elements in IE8, instead stick to the native UI for that old mama.</p>

<p>I’ve used an SVG image for an icon:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
label[for=favcity]::after {
  content: ' ';
  position: absolute;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
  width: 40px;
  height: 100%;
  display: block;
  background: #24d7ea url('images/down-arrow.svg') no-repeat center center;
  pointer-events: none;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>But we are not home yet! Clicking on the right arrow does not make the options list appear, so we’ll need to add ‘pointer-events: none’ to the pseudo-element. As CSS pointer-events don’t work in IE10 and below there will need to be a <a href="http://www.vinylfox.com/forwarding-mouse-events-through-layers/" rel="external" class="underline">JavaScript solution</a>.</p>

<p>There is also the issue of the old dropdown arrow playing peek-a-boo from under the pseudo-element on Firefox and IE.</p>

<p>We can target Firefox with ‘:-moz-any’:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
:-moz-any(select) {
  width: 120%;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>A hidden overflow will need to be applied to the label wrapper.</p>

<p>IE 10 and 11 have their own unique pseudo-element, ‘::-ms-expand’:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
label[for=favcity] select::-ms-expand {
    display: none;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Conditional comments can be used for IE9.</p>

<p>So, we have arrived at our destination, but I need to place a warning here: <em>browser vendors can and do remove support for browser prefixes. Any solution that relies on vendor-specific CSS is temporary and will need to be revised in the future</em>.</p>

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="8472" data-slug-hash="HFAvb" data-default-tab="result" data-user="AndyW" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/AndyW/pen/HFAvb/'>Styling a dropdown select list</a> by Andy Walpole (<a href='http://codepen.io/Andy''>@AndyW</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

<h4>Coding checkboxes</h4>

<p>The code for this form element (checkboxes) is, thankfully, not quite as ‘hacky’ as that used for ‘select’.</p>

<p>This is the design:</p>

<p class="image-container ng-scope">
  <img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/image-five-finished-checkboxes.jpg" width="500" height="100" alt="">
</p>

<p>Don’t try to style the checkbox. Hide it and then use the checkbox labels to position pseudo-elements where the checkbox once sat. There is very little that can be done to a checkbox with CSS. It’s been a while since I tried, but I think a width and height can be set. The browsers that give us most control of the checkbox are IE10 and IE11 through their ‘::-ms-check’ pseudo-element. This is not part of the W3C spec and it will never be implemented in any other browser.</p>

<p>We will hide the checkbox by setting the opacity to 0:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
input[type=checkbox] {
  opacity: 0;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This means that it is still visible in IE8 because that browser doesn’t support the opacity property.</p>

<p>Here’s some basic CSS for the label that lays the groundwork for the implementation of pseudo-elements. We will use both ‘before’ and ‘after’ pseudo-elements: one for the box frame, borders, background, width and height; the other for the tick icon that is displayed in the centre of the box:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
input[type=checkbox] + label::before {
  content: ' ';
  position: absolute;
  left: -35px;
  top: -5px;
  width: 25px;
  height: 25px;
  display: block;
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid #A9A9A9;
}

input[type=checkbox] + label::after {
  content: ' ';
  position: absolute;
  left: -35px;
  top: -5px;
  width: 23px;
  height: 23px;
  display: block;
  z-index: 1;
  background: url('images/tick.svg') no-repeat center center;
  opacity: 0;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>When checked, the opacity becomes 1 and so, correspondingly, the SVG tick icon becomes visible.</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
input[type=checkbox]:checked + label::after {
  opacity: 1;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This approach allows animation to bridge the state changes.</p>

<p>On the default, the transform scale is 0 with a 300 millisecond animation time slot declared:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
transition: all .3s ease;
transform: scale(0);
</code>
</pre>

<p>The checked state is a scale of 1, the original full size.</p>

<p>Try it out:</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Whatever expletives you spit at form elements, nobody can deny that there’s plenty of scope for experimentation, although this has been forced on us by the lack of any sane cross-browser CSS methods.</p>

<p>For now, we continue our journey into the far-flung corners of the CSS vocabulary, picking up properties whose original purpose has been surpassed or forgotten. Think of it as a mission to find a home for abandoned code. Remember, the newly born ‘:-moz-any()’ was once loved by its engineer parent. So, take her home and let her find purpose and meaning again in your CSS form code.</p>

Tips for writing third-party JavaScript

JavaScript

<p>Third-party JavaScript is a niche area in the diverse JavaScript landscape. I would wager that in a room full of professional developers, only one in ten would have any previous experience in this field.</p>

<p>The unique challenges faced in writing third-party JavaScript revolve around the same-origin policy. Because the JavaScript file is based on a different domain to its host, inbuilt browser security places restrictions on cookie use and client-side/server communication. The familiar AJAX method of using the XMLHttpRequest API to send data to the backend is now redundant, and you will need look at using alternatives such as JSONP or the HTML5 postMessage API.</p>

<p>It's also vital to write JavaScript that doesn't clash with code on the host site. By keeping your code within a self-invoking function, everything you provide can be kept within a single global namespace.</p>

<p>I’m just finishing a project that required a third-party script to use in retail advertising. These are some lessons that I learnt during the development process.</p>

</p>

<h4>Use a library for prototyping and then switch to ‘vanilla’</h4>

<p>A sensible approach to tackling a project like this is to create something that works first. You will be experimenting with a lot of different approaches, and using a library like jQuery takes away some of the multi-browser pain points. However, your aim should be to not rely on a library. It is possible to use jQuery conflict-free, but performance is a key element of success in writing third-party JavaScript. Loading a library first is going to have a detrimental impact on rendering times.</p>

<p>By using jQuery for prototyping, you will be deferring full browser support issues until a little later in the project timeline, but by then you should have gained a better understanding of the unique problems inherent when writing third-party JavaScript.</p>

<p>This isn't an approach to be sniffed at; jQuery has come about over several years with the contributions of hundreds of developers. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPaPA30bLUB_publLIMF0RlhdnPx_ePXm7oW02iiT6o/edit#heading=h.4b6lszvv9u4p" class="underline" rel="external">Reading this list here</a> you can see the multitude of browser bugs jQuery smooths over. You need to think carefully about the time and pitfalls you will face if you aim to remove library dependency.</p>

</p>

<h4>Pick the right design pattern</h4>

<p>Successful third-party JavaScript needs to be conflict-free. Nothing you write should cause issues with the existing JavaScript on the host site, and you need to minimise the possibility of their JavaScript creating problems for your code.</p>

<p>This can be difficult with a loosely typed language like JavaScript. There are a lot of coders doing strange stuff with it and not respecting basic best practices.</p>

<p>As always, avoid polluting the global scope. I can't think of any reason why you would need to expose more than one object to the global scope.</p>

<p>Here is the pattern that I used:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
(function(thirdPartyScript, document, window, undefined) {

    'use strict';

    var tps = thirdPartyScript;

    var functionOne = function() {
        return true;
    };

    var functionTwo = function() {
        return true;
    };


    tps.facade = function() {

        functionOne();
        functionTwo();

    };

    tps.facade();

}((window.thirdPartyScript = typeof Object.create !== 'undefined' ? Object.create(null) : {}), document, window));
</code>
</pre>

<p>The object, thirdPartyScript, has one public method, facade(), with functions mimicking the role of private methods.</p>

<p>I chose to use Google Closure as the minifier. If Closure finds an unused function, it will not include it in the production version. However, if you create an internal object with properties that serve as private methods, then Closure will include the object with all its methods, regardless of whether they are being accessed. By using functions that serve as private methods, you can leave code in the development version without worrying about unnecessary code bloat.</p>

<p>There are two sets of functions - one for dealing with cookies, the other for limiting code run until the DOM content is in the viewport - that are not currently being used in production. By using these functions with Google Closure, I could leave them in the development file but out of the production version.</p>

<p>In development, I used 'use strict', discarding it in the production version.</p>

<h4>Make it work in Internet Explorer 6</h4>

<p>Because of the diversity of devices currently used, techniques such as graceful degradation and progressive enhancement are commonly employed. Aim for the largest share of browser support, then provide extra support through polyfills for older browsers, or, with progressive enhancement, provide a base experience for all, adding in additional treats like CSS3 animation, for modern browsers.</p>

<p>It is quite common for a project to have browser support limits. Few web projects today would cater for support for Internet Explorer 6 (IE6), many wouldn't even bother with IE7 or 8, and there’s a big headache in dealing with Android fragmentation across several major versions. What's more, the default Webkit-based WebView browser before Android 4.4 was terrible: no new features were added for two years before its retirement and even remote debugging is impossible.</p>

<p>On this project, the third-party script was for use on a number of large retail websites but such business deals have yet to be completed so, when writing, it was impossible to make any assumptions about browser support. Therefore the JavaScript had to work on all browsers, on all devices. I made one exception to this, Opera Mini, which has extremely limited JavaScript support only allowing a handful of events. But with less than 5 per cent use on mobile platforms in the UK, it was, in my view, okay to leave out.</p>

<p>An astute method of providing near total support on all browsers, on all devices, is to make it work in IE6. If it can work on a 14-year-old browser, then it will be in a strong position for successfully working across the entire fractured Android landscape.</p>

<p>I followed neither progressive enhancement nor graceful degradation, but a mixture of both. In practice, this meant using ECMAScript 5 object methods, which can easily provide fallback alternatives to IE8 and below, and polyfills for native browser APIs like document.getElementsByClassName().</p>

<p>I personally like using the ECMAScript 5 object internal methods in development. With ECMAScript 3 there are no limitations placed on the properties of an object - you can modify, delete or add at will, but with ECMAScript 5, the default is to set restrictions across the board - properties are non-enumerable, configurable and writeable. Privileges are given on a needs-must basis. In my opinion, this is the correct approach to writing object-oriented JavaScript and I find using these methods makes my code sharper. In a production environment for third-party JavaScript, they will stop any developer on the host site from tampering with your script because everything is locked down. Admittedly, this is an edge case but as the primary goal was to avoid conflict between the third-party JavaScript and the code on the host site, I felt more comfortable using these object internal methods.</p>

<p>Using ECMAScript 5 object internal methods, the immediately-invoked function expression now looks like this:<p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
(function(thirdPartyScript, document, window, undefined) {

    'use strict';

    var tps = thirdPartyScript;

    var functionOne = function() {
        return true;
    };

    var functionTwo = function() {
        return true;
    };

    var facade = function() {
        functionOne();
        functionTwo();
    };

    if (typeof Object.defineProperties === 'function') {

        Object.defineProperty(tps, 'facade', {
            enumerable: false,
            configurable: false,
            writable: false,
            value: facade
        });

    } else {

        tps.facade = facade;

    }

    tps.facade();

    if (typeof Object.preventExtensions === 'function') {
        Object.getOwnPropertyNames(tps).forEach(function(key) {
            if (typeof tps[key] === 'function' || typeof e[key] === 'object') {
                Object.preventExtensions(tps[key]);
            } else {
                // remove in production site
                console.log('check global object thirdPartyScript. If you see this message it means that unwanted properties are being added to your thirdPartyScript namespace');
            }
        });

    }

    if (typeof Object.defineProperties === 'function') {

        Object.defineProperty(window, 'thirdPartyScript', {
            enumerable: false,
            configurable: false,
            writable: false,
            value: tps
        });

    } else {

        window.thirdPartyScript = tps;

    }

    if (typeof Object.preventExtensions === 'function') {
        Object.preventExtensions(tps);
    }

}((window.thirdPartyScript = typeof Object.create !== 'undefined' ? Object.create(null) : {}), document, window));

<h4>Don't add any polyfills to the global scope</h4>

<p>Without the use of a JavaScript library, you will most likely need to use a polyfill or two for API support across all browsers.</p>

<p>The typical polyfill in these circumstances uses prototypal inheritance, but don't force your choices on the host. They need to make their own choices for what is right for them.</p>

<p>When required, instead of using prototypal inheritance, I refactored a polyfill into a function. For document.getElementsByClassName(), I used the code written by <a href="http://eike.se/nd" rel="external" class="underline">Eike Send</a>:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var thirdPartyGetElementsByClassName = function(search) {

    if (!document.getElementsByClassName) {

        var d = document;
        var elements;
        var pattern;
        var i;
        var results = [];
        if (d.querySelectorAll) { // IE8
            return d.querySelectorAll('.' + search);
        }
        if (d.evaluate) { // IE6, IE7
            pattern = './/*[contains(concat(\' \', @class, \' \'), \' ' + search + ' \')]';
            elements = d.evaluate(pattern, d, null, 0, null);
            while ((i = elements.iterateNext())) {
                results.push(i);
            }
        } else {
            elements = d.getElementsByTagName('*');
            pattern = new RegExp('(^|\\s)' + search + '(\\s|$)');
            for (i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
                if (pattern.test(elements[i].className)) {
                    results.push(elements[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        return results;

    } else {

        return document.getElementsByClassName(search);

    }

};
</code>
</pre>

<p>Calling the function is straightforward:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var productImage = thirdPartyGetElementsByClassName('clickOnLink');
</code>
</pre>

<h4>Communication #1: transfer data to the host with JSONP</h4>

<p>Due to the same-origin policy, AJAX requests that use the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) API are forbidden. An alternative way of transferring data in this case, HTML to be embedded in the page - is using JSON with padding (JSONP). Browsers do not enforce the same-origin policy on the script tag, so it is possible to work around the same-origin policy via script element injection, typically done with a function invocation.</p>

<p>The restrictions on using this technique limit its usefulness. Only GET requests are allowed and the amount of data is limited to the maximum length of a URL. On older IE versions, this limit is 2,083 characters. For this particular project, only relatively small amounts of HTML needed to be transferred.</p>

<p>JSONP is a hack, really, but it's a well-used method that is known to work in all browsers. It's relatively simple to implement on the server-side but make sure that the MIME Type in the header of the returned file is "application/javascript" or “application/json”.</p>

<p>I started off with <a href="http://oscargodson.com/" rel="external" class="underline">Oscar Godson's</a> small <a href="https://github.com/OscarGodson/JSONP" rel="external" class="underline">JSONP library</a>, which I refactored as the project progressed.</p>

</p>

<h4>Communication #2: return data from the host with the Image Element constructor</h4>

<p>The data that needed to be returned from the host was error handling (which I discuss in the next section) and the unique identification number of the product when the user clicked on the advert (placed as a value in a data-* attribute).</p>

<p>For this I used the Image Element constructor.</p>

<p>This was first brought to my attention by <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/" rel="external" class="underline">Nicholas C. Zakas</a> in his book <em>Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</em>. Like JSONP, it's a hack, if the definition of a hack is using code for purposes other than what it was originally intended for.</p>

<p>First create an image object and then add a URL as its source using the query parameters as a means of identifying the data. On the server-side, this is processed as a GET request:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var img = new Image();
img.src = 'http://example.co.uk/?' + params;
</code>
</pre>

<p>This worked fine as a means of error reporting but became more difficult when working with the click event. For the latter, the user has clicked on the product link and will now expect the page to load. The host, understandably, will not want a third-party script slowing down the user journey. There is a very small window in which to find the product ID and then send this information back to the third-party server to log.</p>

<p>After a lot of testing, I settled on an approach with two different techniques. In one, I inserted a real, tiny 1px by 1px, transparent GIF into the HTML content, with the value of the src attribute being changed in a function invoked with the onpagehide event. The second was for browsers that didn't support the onpagehide event, and which changed the source of the Image Element constructor.</p>

<p>The first part of the code is concerned with inserting the HTML into the right place on the page:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
if (data !== 'nocontent') {

    document.getElementById('thirdPartyScript-container').innerHTML = data;
    tpsHTML = document.getElementById('thirdPartyScript-element');

}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Then a 1px by 1px, transparent GIF is appended to this block of content.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var i = document.createElement('img');
i.src = 'http://example.co.uk/small-image.gif';
i.className = 'clickOnLink';
i.style.display = 'none';
tpsHTML.appendChild(i);
</code>
</pre>

<p>A listener is added to the same HTML (I'm leaving out the code which would register a listener for non-W3C compliant browsers for the purposes of this example):</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
tpsHTML.addEventListener('click', function(event) {

    // code here

}), false);
</code>
</pre>

<p>When the click event occurs the onpagehide event is registered to the window object for those browsers that support this feature. For those that don't, a new Image object is constructed with the query string containing the ID of the product found through DOM transversal in a separate function:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
if ('onpagehide' in window) {

    window.addEventListener('click', updateClickLog, false);

} else {

    var img = new Image();
    img.src = 'http://example.co.uk/click-image.php?userAgent=' + encodeURIComponent(window.navigator.userAgent) + '&idClicked=' + encodeURIComponent(prodID);

}
</code>
</pre>

<p>In the updateClickLog function, the GIF is found through its class name and the source value changed:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var updateClickLog = function() {

    var productImage = document.getElementsByClassName('clickOnLink');

    if (prodID && productImage[0].src) {
        productImage[0].src = 'http://example.co.uk/click-image.php?userAgent=' + encodeURIComponent(window.navigator.userAgent) + '&idClicked=' + encodeURIComponent(prodID);
    }
    window.removeEventListener('click', updateClickLog, false);

};
</code>
</pre>

<p>There are often severe restrictions placed by browsers on third-party cookies, so saving this information in temporary storage and then making a request after the user has navigated to the new page is not an option.</p>

<p>I'm flagging up using the Image Element constructor with the click event as an avenue for you to explore, rather than a ready baked cake to take away. I need to undertake further testing on this code, but so far it’s working on IE6 and above and in all the evergreen browsers on handheld devices, as well as on desktop.</p>

</p>

<h4>Make use of the onerror event handler</h4>

<p>For development, and maybe for production too, make use of the onerror event handler.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
if ('onerror' in window) {

    window.onerror = function(message, url, line) {

        if (typeof url.test !== 'undefined' && url.test(/\/third-party-script(.*?)/)) {

            var error = '&message=' + encodeURIComponent(message) || 0;
            error += '&urlError=' + encodeURIComponent(url) || 0;
            error += '&line=' + encodeURIComponent(line) || 0;

            logError(error);

        }
    };
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This allows us to log JavaScript errors. By using this test() method, we can limit the log to just those errors produced by the third party.</p>

<p>In the logError() function, we build up a query string that includes the URL of the page on the host site where the error occurred (document.location.href), the userAgent string (window.navigator.userAgent) and the screen width and height found with the screen object. These two values are constants that never change, unlike the browser width and height.</p>

<p>Once we have all this data we use the Image Element constructor:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var img = new Image();
img.src = 'http:/example.co.uk/error-log.php?' + error;
</code>
</pre>

<p>The information logged gives us precise details on the cause of the error, and with user details such as userAgent string (find the OS and browser through a site like <a href="http://www.useragentstring.com/index.php">http://www.useragentstring.com/index.php</a>), we can use this data to construct a solution.</p>

<p>The onerror event can also be used on images. The HTML used product image URLs from the host site. If the URL is incorrect and the image fails to load, an error is logged and a temporary placeholder image is used instead.</p>

<h4>Buy a copy of the book <em>Third-Party JavaScript</em></h4>

<p>Written by two experienced <a href="https://disqus.com/" class="underline" rel="external">Disqus</a> frontend engineers, <a href="http://benv.ca/" class="underline" rel="external">Ben Vinegar</a> and <a href="http://anton.kovalyov.net/" class="underline" rel="external">Anton Kovalyov</a>, and released by <a href="http://manning.com/" class="underline" rel="external">Manning Publications</a>, <em>Third-Party JavaScript</em> is an essential manual to use if you are working in this area of web development.</p>

<p>It provides an overview of the problems you are likely to encounter, in particular focusing on the same-origin policy and how that impacts on client/server communication and accessing cookies, but there are lots of clever coding examples with attention always given to browsers that are W3C non-compliant.</p>

<p>I used their approach to cross-browser support for the DOMContentLoaded event, merging their script loading with callback code into my JSONP code.</p>

<p>The DOMContentLoaded is a useful event for third-party JavaScript. This is the earliest moment when a page renders - when the DOM is fully loaded and parsed - that JavaScript can be initiated. It comes before document.onload fires.</p>

<p>But it isn't supported in IE before version 9, and without the use of a library, you will need to provide your own cross-browser fallback. With a book like <em>Third-Party JavaScript</em> guiding you, it's a breeze to provide legacy support for DOMContentLoaded.</p>

<p>My only contention with this book is their enthusiasm for easyXDM, a library that gives cross-browser support for the HTML5 window.postMessage API. Besides JSONP, the postMessage API is another way of circumnavigating same-origin restrictions. My impression of easyXDM is that it is a neglected project, with too little online guidance on its correct use.</p>

<p>As an alternative, I used the <a href="https://github.com/izuzak/pmrpc" class="underline" rel="external">Pmrpc library</a> which I found far easier to deploy due to the online documentation being neatly laid out and also because Pmrpc is still being maintained by the author, <a href="http://ivanzuzak.info" rel="external" class="underline">Ivan Zuzak</a>. It is worth noting, however, that Pmrpc does not support IE7 and below.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>If you like challenges - and what good coder doesn't? - you will enjoy writing third-party JavaScript. The same-origin policy is an essential browser security feature and although it's quite tough to find workarounds, it is possible.</p>

<p>This article only touches on a much wider set of problems and solutions you will come across, which is why I recommend starting your journey with <em>Third-Party JavaScript</em> as your guide. You have been given an opportunity to follow a path that somebody has already beaten down for you, so take it.</p>

<p>This book isn't a complete set of solutions, and you will need to undertake your own research, experimenting beyond its content.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

Why you MUST deploy HTTPS on your website

Security

<p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) has been available for use since the mid-’90s when it was created by Netscape as a security feature for their browser.</p>

<p>Data sent over the internet with a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) connection is done so in plain text which allows easy access for malicious parties who can use man-in-the-middle attacks or wiretapping to access this information.</p>

<p>HTTPS layers HTTP onto the Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) protocol, resulting in the encryption of data being passed through the internet. This is the reason that it is essential to use HTTPS for online financial transactions, otherwise criminals could easily swipe customers’ personal details.</p>

<p>While eCommerce has used HTTPS, by default, for many years, all website owners must now consider using this level of security too.</p>

<h4>All content management systems need HTTPS</h4>

<p>If you have a website built with a content management system (CMS), be it Drupal, Wordpress or Perch, then you likely have administrators with private passwords that are entered into an administrator login page. This is data that needs to be protected with HTTPS.</p>

<p>Dutch developer Erik Romijn identifies when and how to employ HTTPS in his <a href="http://erik.io/blog/2013/06/08/a-basic-guide-to-when-and-how-to-deploy-https/" class="underline" rel="external">blog article from June 2013</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>You should deploy HTTPS whenever your website has any kind of non-public information. That includes any website that has logins – after all, if it were public information, it would not need a login. It also includes logins only used by administrators, like in your typical Wordpress website.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>You should deploy HTTPS because without it, even someone doing passive eavesdropping, i.e. just listening to the network traffic and not manipulating it, can read along with all HTTP traffic, including any passwords or authentication tokens.</p></blockquote>

<p>He lists the correct ways to deploy HTTPS securely: make sure HTTPS is employed across the entire site, not just on login pages; enforce encryption by using a server 302 redirect for HTTP pages to HTTPS; use strict transport security (HSTS); and make sure cookies and sessions have the secure flag set to true.</p>

<h4>SEO and HTTPS</h4>

<p>In March, Matt Cutts, Google’s principal public face of the Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and web development industry, <a href="http://www.bruceclay.com/blog/smx-liveblog-you-a-with-matt-cutts/" class="underline" rel="external">opined on stage at the SMX Conference</a> that he would like to see HTTPS adoption as part of Google’s ranking algorithm.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/04/14/google-may-push-sites-to-use-encryption/" class="underline" rel="author">follow-up article by the Wall Street Journal</a> went into more depth on the issue:</p>

<blockquote><p>Cutts also has spoken in private conversations of Google’s interest in making the change, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person says Google’s internal discussions about encryption are still at an early stage and any change wouldn’t happen soon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Clearing up any confusion, <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html" class="underline" rel="external">Google officially announced at the beginning of August that HTTPS was now a ranking factor</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>[O]ver the past few months we’ve been running tests taking into account whether sites use secure, encrypted connections as a signal in our search ranking algorithms. We've seen positive results, so we're starting to use HTTPS as a ranking signal. For now it's only a very lightweight signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global queries, and carrying less weight than other signals such as high-quality content — while we give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS. But over time, we may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.</p></blockquote>

<p>Regardless of Google’s stance on this subject, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/ranking-benefit-making-site-ssl-yet-googles-cutts-like-make-happen-186810" class="underline" rel="external">SEO expert Barry Schwartz believes that website encryption should be widely adopted</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>[M]ost of the new sites my company launches has [sic] been defaulted to run over HTTPS instead of HTTP. The costs are minimal and clearly there is a trend happening here. Migrating older sites can be some work but new sites, for the most part, likely should strongly consider going HTTPS by default.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Financial and performance costs of HTTPS</h4>

<p>For a long time, the use of HTTPS has been considered to negatively impact performance but, properly configured, this does not need to be the case.</p>

<p>Dutch-based developer Joost de Valk has <a href="https://yoast.com/move-website-https-ssl/" class="underline" rel="external">written a comprehensive guide on moving a site from HTTP to HTTPS</a></p>

<p>For his site, using SPDY (it looks like another acronym, but it’s not!) was key to good performance with HTTPS. SPDY, which will be part of HTTP 2.0, is an open web protocol developed by Google that reduces page loading times when using HTTPS. At the moment, the only modern browser not supporting SPDY is Safari, but this will change when the next Mac OS, Yosemite, is released.</p>

<p>In regards to cost, it is not necessary to spend hundreds of dollars on an SSL certificate. Spending a modest amount annually (under $100) is satisfactory for most sites.</p>

<p>One mistake I made when implementing HTTPS on this site was not including an intermediate certificate of the Root Certificate Authority (CA). This meant an extra 'handshake' for browsers and, as such, worse performance, and, in the case of Firefox, a warning to users that the domain was unsafe.</p>

<p>To check whether your implementation is correct you can use the free scanner provided by <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" class="underline" rel="external">Qualys SSL Labs</a>.</p>

<p>Also use <a href="https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html" class="underline" rel="external">SSL Checker</a> to ensure that you have all required certificates installed.</p>

<h4>Reset the Net</h4>

<p>On June 5th, <a href="https://www.resetthenet.org/" class="underline" rel="external">Reset the Net</a> was launched:</p>

<p class="video-container">

</p>

<p>In response to the snooping activities of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), as revealed by documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a number of technology companies came together under one banner promoting better web security. One part of this involved a push for the adoption of HTTPS, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and perfect forward secrecy (PFS) by website owners.</p>

<p>This isn't about creating an environment of paranoia where we all believe we are being targeted by the secret service agencies, but, instead, fostering a culture of security where, by default, all of us place privacy at the heart of our everyday activities. For website owners, this means deploying HTTPS.</p>

<p>Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, spoke at the recent <a href="https://www.dontspyonus.org.uk/day-of-action" class="underline" rel="external">Don’t Spy On Us Day of Action</a> event in London this June. He commented on why Wikipedia now employs sitewide HTTPS.</p>

<p>I provide his explanation in full because it is an important read (the emphasis in the last sentence is mine):</p>

<blockquote><p>For a very long time at Wikipedia we had this notion that we would like to be SSL by default. So that when you come to Wikipedia if somebody is snooping on your connection the only thing they’ll be able to see is that you are reading Wikipedia which isn’t necessarily that informative because there is a lot of stuff on Wikipedia.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>We always thought this was a good idea but there was always this feeling, particularly in the early days, that it would be very expensive; and I think that was actually true for a long time.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And then Google put out this very nice blog post when they encrypted connections to Gmail and they said, Actually it doesn’t cost that much anymore.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>So we started looking at it and we were planning to do it and roll it out but we are a busy engineering organisation and it wasn’t necessarily our top priority, and then suddenly this Snowden slide came out listing Wikipedia as one of the easy sites to snoop on, and you can imagine that our engineers went ballistic at that point. It was incredibly offensive. I tweeted some expletives about it. I was very angry.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And so we did it very quickly. <em>And now every time I go to a website and the connection of that website is not encrypted I think, Why not? Why isn’t it?</em></p></blockquote>

Creating accessible forms using AngularJS


<p>We should all try to code to meet accessibility standards but few of us do. As a contractor in London, there hasn’t been a single job I have undertaken where accessibility has been one of the central goals. And these have all been jobs with large multinational companies, including one in the education sector.</p>

<p>This poor state of affairs has come about through lack of interest from the decision makers at the top. For whatever reason, those that commission websites and those that make them do not consider accessibility a key concern. Discussing ideas about how accessibility can be prioritised is a subject for another article, but I would recommend reading <em><a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-gibson/2014-July-31" class="underline" rel="external">An Alphabet of Accessibility Issues</a></em> by Anne Gibson to introduce yourself to the wide range of disabilities that affect a multitude of web users.</p>

<p>Every now and again, I turn on my Mac VoiceOver and navigate through a website I have coded. It’s a revealing experience that demonstrates the usefulness of alt text for images and forms’ input labels for screen reader users.</p>

<p>The results shouldn’t be taken as an objective accessibility experience because screen reader users don’t use their software "straight out of the box", but heavily configure it for their own personal use.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for us able-bodied coders, using a screen reader is an educational experience that I would recommend everybody try.</p>

<p>Recently, I carried out this exercise on my own blog. Trying to submit a form and handle error messages proved to be a confusing experience. So I decided to recode the comments form, checking again with VoiceOver as I made each adjustment.</p>

<p>The comments form was unexceptional. It was a basic form that used AngularJS’s inbuilt validation.</p>

<p>The design of the form used placeholder text but I still used labels and hid them with accessible-friendly CSS.</p>

<p>Here is the HTML of a form field:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;span class="email-block"&gt
&lt;label for="email" class="visuallyhidden"&gtYour email address&lt;/label&gt
&lt;span data-ng-show="contactForm.email.$invalid && submitted" class="error-message"&gtPlease supply a valid email address.&lt;/span&gt
&lt;input type="email" id="email" name="email" value="" placeholder="Your email address" required="required" class="input" data-ng-required="true" data-ng-model="contact.email" maxlength="64" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off"/&gt
&lt;/span&gt
</code>
</pre>

<p>Error messages are revealed on form submission. In the form field above it reads "Please supply a valid email address".</p>

<p>Visually, the error messages are placed above the form field:</p>

<p class="image-container">
<img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/creating-accessible-forms-using-angularjs-screenshot-one.jpg" alt="Screenshot of comments before implementing acceessible-friendly code">
</p>

<p>The form labels are hidden with the following CSS:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
/*
* Hide only visually, but have it available for screen readers: h5bp.com/v
*/
.visuallyhidden {
    border: 0;
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
    height: 1px;
    margin: -1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    padding: 0;
    position: absolute;
    width: 1px;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is lifted, with thanks, straight from the HTML5 Boilerplate.</p>

<p>When I amended the form I used ARIA roles to assist with accessibility. The form field code now reads:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;span class="email-block"&gt
&lt;label for="email" class="visuallyhidden"&gtYour email address&lt;/label&gt
&lt;span data-ng-show="commentForm.email.$invalid && commentBlogFormSubmit" class="error-message" aria-labelledby="email" role="alert"&gtError: Please provide an email address.&lt;/span&gt
&lt;input type="email" name="email" id="email" value="" placeholder="Email (will be kept private)" required="required" data-ng-model="commentFormData.email" data-ng-required="true" aria-required="true" class="input" maxlength="200" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off"/&gt
&lt;/span&gt
</code>
</pre>

<p>Note the addition of 'aria-required' as well as HTML5 required. </p>

<p>The error message now uses 'aria-labelledby' to connect the error message with the input field, plus the addition of ' role="alert" '.</p>

<p>Above the form, I placed a generic error message to be displayed if errors occur:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;p data-ng-if="formFailure" class="comment-form-failure" data-ng-bind="formFailure" tabindex="0"&gt&lt;/p&gt
</code>
</pre>

<p>Using 'ngIf' means this paragraph is absent from the DOM unless there is a form error. The 'tabindex' is required for the JavaScript focus event to work and is called into the controller if an error occurs (yes, this probably should be in a directive):</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
 if (!isValid) {

     $scope.formFailure = 'The form has not been submitted because of errors. Please review the form error messages and click submit again';

     $timeout(function() {
         document.querySelector('.comment-form-failure').focus();
     }, 0);

 }
</code>
</pre>

<p>On a successful submission, the code in the controller is as follows:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
$scope.formFailure = null;
$scope.formSuccess = 'You have successfully submitted a blog comment';
$timeout(function() {
    document.querySelector('.comment-form-success').focus();
}, 0);
</code>
</pre>

<p>The code for a successful submission in the template is:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;p data-ng-if="formSuccess" class="comment-form-success" data-ng-bind="formSuccess" tabindex="0"&gt&lt;/p&gt
</code>
</pre>

<p>The form when errors are triggered now looks like this:</p>

Using JavaScript to create a GUID from a user’s browser information


<p>There may be a time when you need to assign a unique identifier to a user to monitor their subsequent journey. Perhaps the user is served an advert but the advertiser needs to collect statistics to correlate ad impressions with product purchases.</p>

<p>The trigger for purchasing intentions could be when they click on the “Add to basket” button. Here you will need to inform the server of what item has been has been actioned and whether this user had previously viewed the advert.</p>

<p>Storing a GUID in a cookie will allow you to connect the two actions together.</p>

<p>Browsers do not carry any one piece of information that is unique to the user. Everybody has an IP address, but this same IP address could be used by hundreds in a company or by thousands using a VPN. </p>

<p>Using JavaScript, it is possible to string together various values created by global objects like window.navigator and window.screen so as to produce a GUID.</p>

<p>In 2010 the Electronic Freedom Frontier launched a research project called <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/" class="underline" rel="external">Panopticlick</a> that anonymously recorded users’ browser data to assess whether unique fingerprints are created by publicly available browser information.</p>

<p>Running their in-browser script I am informed:</p>

<blockquote><p>Your browser fingerprint appears to be unique among the 4,303,345 tested so far.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Currently, we estimate that your browser has a fingerprint that conveys at least 22.04 bits of identifying information.</p></blockquote>

<p>They conclude in <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/browser-uniqueness.pdf" class="underline" rel="external">their research document</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In this sample of privacy-conscious users, 83.6% of the browsers seen had an instantaneously unique fingerprint, and a further 5.3% had an anonymity set of size 2. Among visiting browsers that had either Adobe Flash or a Java Virtual Machine enabled, 94.2% exhibited instantaneously unique fingerprints and a further 4.8% had fingerprints that were seen exactly twice. Only 1.0% of browsers with Flash or Java had anonymity sets larger than two. <em>Overall, we were able to place a lower bound on the fingerprint distribution entropy of 18.1 bits, meaning that if we pick a browser at random, at best only one in 286,777 other browsers will share its fingerprint.</em> (my emphasis) </p></blockquote>

<p>So while we will not be able to create a GUID to RFC4122 standards, we can certainly put together a robust algorithm that can help in gathering data about user session behaviour.</p>

<p>The first, obvious place for browser information is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator" class="underline" rel="external">Navigator object</a> which can be accessed with the read-only window.navigator property.</p>

<p>Of particular interest are the UserAgent, the number of browser plugins and the MIME types recognized by the browser, which are properties of window.navigator:</p>

<p><strong>window.navigator.userAgent</strong> = userAgent string, ie Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.125 Safari/537.36</p>

<p><strong>window.navigator.plugins.length</strong> = number of browser plugins.</p>

<p><strong>window.navigator.mimeTypes.length</strong> = length of the MimeTypeArray object</p>

<p>For easier database storage and retrieval it’s best to only store digits. Take out the non-numeric characters from the userAgent string with this simple regex:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
window.navigator.userAgent.replace(/\D+/g, '');
</code>
</pre>

<p>More clues to unique browser identifiers are in this Webkit document, <a href="https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/Fingerprinting" class="underline" rel="external">Fingerprinting</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.screen" rel="external" class="underline">window.screen object</a> can lead to entropy values as much as 4.83 bits.</p>

<p>A few of note are window.screen.height, window.screen.width and window.screen.pixelDepth.</p>

<p>Another route to explore for unique identifiers is the number of system fonts that can be <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/system-fonts-javascript/#highlighter_161053" class="underline" rel="external">detected with Flash</a>:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
try {
    //adds a swf to the page and reads fonts
    $('body').append('&lt;div id="flashcontent"&gt &lt;/div&gt');
    $('#flashcontent').flash({
        "src": "resources/FontList.swf",
        "width": "1",
        "height": "1",
        "swliveconnect": "true",
        "id": "flashfontshelper",
        "name": "flashfontshelper"
    }, {
        update: false
    });

    //timeout required for swf to settle.
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(window.fonts);
        return window.fonts;
    }, _this.settings.flashDelay);
} catch (ex) {
    _this.errors.push('No fonts detected.');
    return fonts;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>But this is too expensive for a performance-minded script.</p>

<p>Here’s a function that concatenates some of the above information and returns a string of approximately 40 numbers in length:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
  /**
   * @function _guid
   * @description Creates GUID for user based on several different browser variables
   * It will never be RFC4122 compliant but it is robust
   * @returns {Number}
   * @private
   */
  var guid = function() {

      var nav = window.navigator;
      var screen = window.screen;
      var guid = nav.mimeTypes.length;
      guid += nav.userAgent.replace(/\D+/g, '');
      guid += nav.plugins.length;
      guid += screen.height || '';
      guid += screen.width || '';
      guid += screen.pixelDepth || '';

      return guid;
  };
</code>
</pre>

<p>If you do need to store the user-journey of your visitors then please respect their <a href="http://donottrack.us/" class="underline" rel="external">Do Not Track (DNT)</a> preferences.</p>

<p>Here’s a function you can use for this purpose:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
/**
   * @function doNotTrack
   * @description Checks if use has declared Do Not Track (DNT) in their browser
   * Ignores IE10: Read this for further explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track#Internet_Explorer_10_default_setting_controversy
   * @returns {*}
   */

  var doNotTrack = function () {

    if (!window.navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE\s10\.0|trident\/6\.0/i)) {
      return window.navigator.doNotTrack || window.navigator.msDoNotTrack;
    }
  };
</code>
</pre>

<h3>One fingerprint, one user</h3>

<p>The above is a means of monitoring a single user for a single session. The information captured is extremely unlikely to change in the course of that session. It’s also completely anonymous. It is not possible to match the GUID to John Abrack of 124 Petersfield Avenue, New Jersey, for example. However, creating a unique browser fingerprint - one that persists across sessions - has been the holy grail of advertising for years.</p>

<p>Governments too would like a globally unique identifier to match to individual internet users. There’s been rumours - quite likely true, given their past form - that the British government has been exploring this quietly behind closed doors.</p>

<p>Maybe the NSA have already cracked it (what a giant database that would be!), but advertisers are still trying.</p>

<p>Just recently the “free” social bookmarking widget AddThis was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140721/14523127960/tons-sites-including-whitehousegov-experiment-with-tracking-technology-that-is-difficult-to-block.shtml" class="underline" rel="external">exposed for using relatively sophisticated fingerprinting to track their users across the web</a>.</p>

<p>Exploiting the <a href="http://www.browserleaks.com/canvas" rel="external" class="underline">JavaScript-based Canvas API</a>, it is possible to create an almost unique identifier for every desktop or handheld device. But it’s not 100% accurate, and AddThis, when announcing their withdrawal from the scheme, claimed that it’s accuracy rate was no higher than 90%.</p>

<p>But it’s not just the Canvas fingerprinting that is deployed as a tracking device, there are several other methods too such as the <a href="http://samy.pl/evercookie/" class="underline" rel="external">evercookie</a>. With the help of Flash, evercookie leaves a presence in several different places in the browser, so if the user clears their cookie cache, as they often do, the same cookie can still be found in their web history or their cache or as a value in their window.name object. In fact, the author of evercookie identifies 12 different places on a browser where a cookie or cookie-like item can be stored, or rather, hidden without the user’s knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>There is also an open-source library called <a href="https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs" class="underline" rel="external">fingerprintjs</a> that uses the same tehnique I have demonstrated above, except the author, <a href="https://valve.github.io/" rel="external" class="underline">Valentin Vasilyev</a>, choose to record the browser agent, browser language, screen color depth, installed plugins and their mime types, timezone offset, local storage, and session storage.</p>

<p>These values are then passed through a hashing function to generate further defined individuality. This function uses Mumour, the hashing algorithm used by fingerprintjs:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
murmurhash3_32_gc: function(key, seed) {
    var remainder, bytes, h1, h1b, c1, c2, k1, i;

    remainder = key.length & 3; // key.length % 4
    bytes = key.length - remainder;
    h1 = seed;
    c1 = 0xcc9e2d51;
    c2 = 0x1b873593;
    i = 0;

    while (i < bytes) {
        k1 =
            ((key.charCodeAt(i) & 0xff)) |
            ((key.charCodeAt(++i) & 0xff) << 8) |
            ((key.charCodeAt(++i) & 0xff) << 16) |
            ((key.charCodeAt(++i) & 0xff) << 24);
        ++i;

        k1 = ((((k1 & 0xffff) * c1) + ((((k1 >>> 16) * c1) & 0xffff) << 16))) & 0xffffffff;
        k1 = (k1 << 15) | (k1 >>> 17);
        k1 = ((((k1 & 0xffff) * c2) + ((((k1 >>> 16) * c2) & 0xffff) << 16))) & 0xffffffff;

        h1 ^= k1;
        h1 = (h1 << 13) | (h1 >>> 19);
        h1b = ((((h1 & 0xffff) * 5) + ((((h1 >>> 16) * 5) & 0xffff) << 16))) & 0xffffffff;
        h1 = (((h1b & 0xffff) + 0x6b64) + ((((h1b >>> 16) + 0xe654) & 0xffff) << 16));
    }

    k1 = 0;

    switch (remainder) {
        case 3:
            k1 ^= (key.charCodeAt(i + 2) & 0xff) << 16;
        case 2:
            k1 ^= (key.charCodeAt(i + 1) & 0xff) << 8;
        case 1:
            k1 ^= (key.charCodeAt(i) & 0xff);

            k1 = (((k1 & 0xffff) * c1) + ((((k1 >>> 16) * c1) & 0xffff) << 16)) & 0xffffffff;
            k1 = (k1 << 15) | (k1 >>> 17);
            k1 = (((k1 & 0xffff) * c2) + ((((k1 >>> 16) * c2) & 0xffff) << 16)) & 0xffffffff;
            h1 ^= k1;
    }

    h1 ^= key.length;

    h1 ^= h1 >>> 16;
    h1 = (((h1 & 0xffff) * 0x85ebca6b) + ((((h1 >>> 16) * 0x85ebca6b) & 0xffff) << 16)) & 0xffffffff;
    h1 ^= h1 >>> 13;
    h1 = ((((h1 & 0xffff) * 0xc2b2ae35) + ((((h1 >>> 16) * 0xc2b2ae35) & 0xffff) << 16))) & 0xffffffff;
    h1 ^= h1 >>> 16;

    return h1 >>> 0;
},
</code>
</pre>

<p>Claiming to have tested its robustness on millions of visitors, Vasilyev officially abandoned its use in July 2014, citing accuracy levels of 89% with handheld devices proving particularly challenging: “ browser fingerprinting is not good with mobile browsers”.</p>

<p><a href="https://valve.github.io/blog/2013/07/14/anonymous-browser-fingerprinting/" class="underline" rel="external">He stated</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>After viewing the results we removed the fingerprinting because of poor identification, especially with mobile devices. If your traffic mostly comes from desktops and you’re OK with 10-12% of false identifications you might want to try it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Today’s browsers, if the user decides opts out of third-party cookie monitoring, are very stringent in enforcing their users’ preferences; which is why so many commercial entities are exploring non-cookie alternatives. </p>

<p>Canvas fingerprinting, used for five months by AddThis, is impossible to remove.</p>

<p>Other cookie alternatives include an exploit of the new HTML5 IndexedDB client-based database and Flash cookies, plus, undoubtedly several techniques yet to be discovered by privacy campaigners.</p>

<p>It’s not that cookies don’t have a role to play in both website functionality and limited commercial activity, but placing long-term, secret trackers on users’ electronic devices is no more ethical than bugging phones and cars to monitor day-to-day activity in the pursuit of profit.</p>

<h3>The end of the third-party cookie?</h3>

<p>It has been the subject of rumour for months but it <a href="http://blog.decisive.is/post/89065034977/the-death-of-the-cookie" class="underline" rel="external">now appears likely that browsers will automatically block third-party cookies</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>A multitude of privacy advocacy groups have been complaining about cookies for a long time. After all, although cookies don’t record specific personal information, they do record information about online browsing habits without the knowledge or consent of Internet users. Pressure from advocacy groups, pressure from the government, and the migration from desktop browsing to mobile devices are converging to push third-party cookies out of existence.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>If there’s been pressure to stop or regulate third-party cookies for many years, why are cookies only becoming endangered now? <em>Three of the biggest web browsers — Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — will soon be rolling out updated browsers whose default settings block third-party cookies.</em> Many consumers and privacy advocates will cheer; many marketers who rely upon cookies, though, aren’t happy at all.” (my emphasis)</p></blockquote>

<p>But we have been served this same link-bait story numerous times over the past year or two, and if browser vendors adopt a hardline stance against cookies, malignant forces are waiting to step into the tracking vacuum with <a href="http://www.subscriptioncontent.net/the-death-of-cookies-and-the-future-of-audience-tracking-for-subscription-sites/" class="underline" rel="external">sub-dystopian mechanisms of monitoring</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>… another company is developing technology that tracks audiences one layer up, on the wi-fi level. And another company, Drawbridge, has figured out how to determine that a cellphone, work computer, home computer and tablet belong to the same person, without cookies and even if the devices are in no way connected.</p></blockquote>

Creating accessible forms using AngularJS

AngularJS

<p>We should all try to code to meet accessibility standards but few of us do. As a contractor in London, there hasn’t been a single job I have undertaken where accessibility has been one of the central goals. And these have all been jobs with large multinational companies, including one in the education sector.</p>

<p>This poor state of affairs has come about through lack of interest from the decision makers at the top. For whatever reason, those that commission websites and those that make them do not consider accessibility a key concern. Discussing ideas about how accessibility can be prioritised is a subject for another article, but I would recommend reading <em><a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-gibson/2014-July-31" class="underline" rel="external">An Alphabet of Accessibility Issues</a></em> by Anne Gibson to introduce yourself to the wide range of disabilities that affect a multitude of web users.</p>

<p>Every now and again, I turn on my Mac VoiceOver and navigate through a website I have coded. It’s a revealing experience that demonstrates the usefulness of alt text for images and forms’ input labels for screen reader users.</p>

<p>The results shouldn’t be taken as an objective accessibility experience because screen reader users don’t use their software "straight out of the box", but heavily configure it for their own personal use.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for us able-bodied coders, using a screen reader is an educational experience that I would recommend everybody try.</p>

<p>Recently, I carried out this exercise on my own blog. Trying to submit a form and handle error messages proved to be a confusing experience. So I decided to recode the comments form, checking again with VoiceOver as I made each adjustment.</p>

<p>The comments form was unexceptional. It was a basic form that used AngularJS’s inbuilt validation.</p>

<p>The design of the form used placeholder text but I still used labels and hid them with accessible-friendly CSS.</p>

<p>Here is the HTML of a form field:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;span class="email-block"&gt
&lt;label for="email" class="visuallyhidden"&gtYour email address&lt;/label&gt
&lt;span data-ng-show="contactForm.email.$invalid && submitted" class="error-message"&gtPlease supply a valid email address.&lt;/span&gt
&lt;input type="email" id="email" name="email" value="" placeholder="Your email address" required="required" class="input" data-ng-required="true" data-ng-model="contact.email" maxlength="64" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off"/&gt
&lt;/span&gt
</code>
</pre>

<p>Error messages are revealed on form submission. In the form field above it reads "Please supply a valid email address".</p>

<p>Visually, the error messages are placed above the form field:</p>

<p class="image-container">
<img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/creating-accessible-forms-using-angularjs-screenshot-one.jpg" alt="Screenshot of comments before implementing acceessible-friendly code">
</p>

<p>The form labels are hidden with the following CSS:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
/*
* Hide only visually, but have it available for screen readers: h5bp.com/v
*/
.visuallyhidden {
    border: 0;
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
    height: 1px;
    margin: -1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    padding: 0;
    position: absolute;
    width: 1px;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is lifted, with thanks, straight from the HTML5 Boilerplate.</p>

<p>When I amended the form I used ARIA roles to assist with accessibility. The form field code now reads:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;span class="email-block"&gt
&lt;label for="email" class="visuallyhidden"&gtYour email address&lt;/label&gt
&lt;span data-ng-show="commentForm.email.$invalid && commentBlogFormSubmit" class="error-message" aria-labelledby="email" role="alert"&gtError: Please provide an email address.&lt;/span&gt
&lt;input type="email" name="email" id="email" value="" placeholder="Email (will be kept private)" required="required" data-ng-model="commentFormData.email" data-ng-required="true" aria-required="true" class="input" maxlength="200" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off"/&gt
&lt;/span&gt
</code>
</pre>

<p>Note the addition of 'aria-required' as well as HTML5 required. </p>

<p>The error message now uses 'aria-labelledby' to connect the error message with the input field, plus the addition of ' role="alert" '.</p>

<p>Above the form, I placed a generic error message to be displayed if errors occur:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;p data-ng-if="formFailure" class="comment-form-failure" data-ng-bind="formFailure" tabindex="0"&gt&lt;/p&gt
</code>
</pre>

<p>Using 'ngIf' means this paragraph is absent from the DOM unless there is a form error. The 'tabindex' is required for the JavaScript focus event to work and is called into the controller if an error occurs (yes, this probably should be in a directive):</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
 if (!isValid) {

     $scope.formFailure = 'The form has not been submitted because of errors. Please review the form error messages and click submit again';

     $timeout(function() {
         document.querySelector('.comment-form-failure').focus();
     }, 0);

 }
</code>
</pre>

<p>On a successful submission, the code in the controller is as follows:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
$scope.formFailure = null;
$scope.formSuccess = 'You have successfully submitted a blog comment';
$timeout(function() {
    document.querySelector('.comment-form-success').focus();
}, 0);
</code>

Using SASS for typographic vertical rhythm

SASS

<p>Several years ago, when grids were first popularised in web design, Craig Grannell wrote an article for Net magazine detailing a CSS method that mimicked print design for typographic rhythm.</p>

<p>I have being using this same CSS approach from 2007 onwards. I’ve tried different methods, like those detailed by <a href="http://gregrickaby.com/using-the-golden-ratio-and-rems/" class="underline" rel="external">Greg Ricaby</a> and <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/02/08/unitless-line-heights/" class="underline" rel="external">Eric Mayer</a>, but none, for me at least, have beaten Craig Grannell’s original take on CSS typography.</p>

<p>Let me state that there is no perfect method. CSS line-height is flawed because the text does not sit square on the baseline. Therefor, no matter how clever your calculations are you will be making manual corrections to some headers outside the system you use. What’s more, not only do you have to contend with the size and margins of fonts, but also the margins and heights of container elements, images and other objects inserted into the page. And when using a CMS, these measurements vary wildly.</p>

<p>So while perfection is almost unattainable (unless you want to go mad trying), we can at least aim for a workable mathematical system to produce a neat vertical ordering which is pleasing to the human eye.</p>

<p>In all the years I’ve used this technique, a designer has never found fault with my typography layout. They have found fault with lots else! But so far I’ve come through a designers review without requests to change line height or margins.</p>

<p>Before I bring SASS into the discussion, I will quickly explain this technique.</p>

<p>First of all in the body set a percentage font size. Remember, the default font size in all browsers is 16px. Using a percentage of 62.5% changes this to 10px. With the relative unit measurement of EMs this means that 1em = 10px. This is an easy number to work with: 1.2em = 12px, 1.5em = 15px and so on.</p>

<p>If you prefer working with a different base font-size then use this <a href="http://pxtoem.com/" class="underline" rel="external">PX to EM conversion tool</a>.

<p>Now we can add a default font family. This blog uses the latest font superstar, Open Sans:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
body {
    font-size: 62.5%;
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>In the body there is one last addition for line-height:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
body {
    font-size: 62.5%;
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    line-height: 2.5em;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The value depends on the design, but it will range from 1.8 to 3ems.</p>

<p>Now we will use these measurements for headers, lists and paragraphs.</p>

<p>Lets say we have a header of 26px:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
h2 {
    font-size: 2.6em;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The margin below is calculated by dividing the base line-height by the font-size. In this case it is 2.5 / 2.6, which gives us a result of 0.96:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
h2 {
    font-size: 2.6em;
    margin-bottom: 0.96em;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Repeat the same calculation method for all font elements. If the margin is too large for the design, then either half or reduce it by a factor of 4. If you are going to use a mathematical system then keep using it throughout the stylesheet. Do not just suddenly enter values that “feel right”. Always aim for consistency. </p>

<p>There will be problems with large size fonts due to insufficient line-height. You may need to manually enter a bigger line-height value in these cases.</p>

<p>Other than that, this method should serve you as well as it has served me.</p>

<p>With the use of SASS we can create a mixin to do the calculations for us.</p>

<p>This is where the code becomes more complicated, so bear with me.</p>

<p>Instead of using the PX to EM calculator that I linked to above, lets create our own function that uses the same conversion figures:</p>

<pre class="language-scss">
<code>
@function basefont-to-pixel($baseFS) {
  // see http://pxtoem.com/
  @if $baseFS == 37.5% {
    @return 6;
  } @else if $baseFS == 43.8% {
    @return 7;
  } @else if $baseFS == 50.0% {
    @return 8;
  } @else if $baseFS == 56.3% {
    @return 9;
  } @else if $baseFS == 62.5% {
    @return 10;
  } @else if $baseFS == 68.8% {
    @return 11;
  } @else if $baseFS == 75.0% {
    @return 12;
  } @else if $baseFS == 81.3% {
    @return 13;
  } @else if $baseFS == 87.5% {
    @return 14;
  } @else if $baseFS == 93.8% {
    @return 15;
  } @else if $baseFS == 100.0% {
    @return 16;
  }

}
</code>
</pre>

<p>We also need another helper function to strip measurement units:</p>

<pre class="language-scss">
<code>
@function strip-units($number) {
  @return $number / ($number * 0 + 1);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Both of these are used in the font-calculator mixin:</p>

<pre class="language-scss">
<code>
@mixin font-calculator($fontFamily, $fontSize, $divider: null) {

  $fontSizeEm: strip-units($fontSize) / basefont-to-pixel($baseFontSize);
  font-size: #{$fontSizeEm}#{"em"};
  font-family: #{$fontFamily};

  @if $divider == 0 {
    $margin: null;
  } @else if $divider == 2 {
    $margin: (strip-units($baseLineHeight) / $fontSizeEm) * 2;
    margin-bottom: #{$margin}#{"em"};
  } @else if $divider == 1 {
    $margin: (strip-units($baseLineHeight) / $fontSizeEm);
    margin-bottom: #{$margin}#{"em"};
  } @else if $divider == 1.5 {
    $margin: (strip-units($baseLineHeight) / $fontSizeEm) * 1.5;
    margin-bottom: #{$margin}#{"em"};
  } @else if $divider == 0.5 {
    $margin: strip-units($baseLineHeight) / $fontSizeEm / 2;
    margin-bottom: #{$margin}#{"em"};
  } @else if $divider == 0.25 {
    $margin: strip-units($baseLineHeight) / $fontSizeEm / 4;
    margin-bottom: #{$margin}#{"em"};
  } @else if $divider == null {
    $margin: strip-units($baseLineHeight) / $fontSizeEm;
    margin-bottom: #{$margin}#{"em"};
  }

}
</code>
</pre>

<p>It uses the exactly the same maths as I have already detailed in this article.</p>

<p>Below are some examples that use this mixin.</p>

<pre class="language-scss">
<code>
.blog article h4 {
  @include font-calculator($baseFontFamily, 26px);
  font-weight: 600;
  color: $textTwo;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The above is compiled into the following CSS:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
.blog article h4 {
  font-size: 2.6em;
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  margin-bottom: 0.96154em;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: #666666;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>A different example:</p>

<pre class="language-scss">
<code>
.content-text .user-comments section {
  @include font-calculator($baseFontFamily, 16px, 0);
  color: $textTwo;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Adding a third parameter of 0 means that there is no bottom margin:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
.content-text .user-comments section {
  font-size: 1.6em;
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  color: #666666;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>A third example: </p>

<pre class="language-scss">
<code>
.admin-comments dd, .content-text aside dd {
  @include font-calculator($baseFontFamily, 14px, 0.5);
  font-weight: 400;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The value of 0.5 will half the size of the bottom margin:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
.admin-comments dd, .content-text aside dd {
  font-size: 1.4em;
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  margin-bottom: 0.89286em;
  font-weight: 400;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>I used this SASS mixin and helper functions when coding this site and they can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/TCotton/portfolio/blob/master/app/styles/_mixins.scss" class="underline" rel="external">GitHub account</a>.</p>

<p>If you are using Compass, then I would recommend investigating <a href="https://medium.com/typography/using-sass-compass-vertical-rhythm-to-set-up-typography-defaults-in-a-project-34fe2f1d2c02" class="underline" rel="external">Vertical Rhythm</a>. It looks a very powerful, well-constructed SASS aid.</p>

<p>I hope you haven’t found the above too complicated. Remember the key calculation for bottom margins is base line-height / font size.</p>

<p>And by all means try different methods recommended by other coders to find one that you are most comfortable with. There are quite a few out there if you search for them.</p>


Report on Don’t Spy On Us: Day of Action, Shoreditch Town Hall, June 7

Surveillance

<p>One year ago the documents released by whistleblower Edwards Snowden were first published by a number of newspapers.</p>
<p>The relationship between power and technology was revealed in detail. The World Wide Web, an indispensable facet of contemporary commerce and communication, had been hacked, subverted, undermined and weakened by the concerted efforts of multiple Western intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Within the cache of documents, it was not just the technical details which proved revealing, but secret service attitude - part fear, part disdain - to the internet infrastructure they sought ascent over: one slide was headlined “The Threat Today” with “The Internet” first in their list of targets.</p>
<p>Hidden from public discourse, powerful government entities had declared war on the web. Edward Snowden was an individual in their pay who not only questioned his employers practices, but was also prepared to act upon his ethical concerns. He was not the first in recent times, but with him he carried the documentation that those who came before had lacked.</p>
<p>The reporting on the leaks had an air of theatre to the proceedings as Snowden was chased across continents by his former masters, while <em>The Guardian</em> was subject to GCHQ demands to physically destroy the hardware where the documents were stored.</p>
<p>Their blanket of total secrecy, cherished for decades, had been removed. In their eyes, not only the whistleblower but also all those that aided him were a threat equal to Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>The debate in Britain was dampened by the refusal of most of the mainstream media to cover the issue; perhaps they were cowered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DA-Notice" class="underline" rel="external">government D-Notices</a> or by a tribal loyalty to the class and institutions their birthright or cultivated affinities lie with.</p>
<p>I cannot think of one single British TV current affairs programme of the stature of <em>Dispatches</em> or <em>Panorama</em> over the last 12 months that has investigated the story, while the BBC’s <em>Today</em> news programme (9 million morning listeners) either ignored the latest developments or relegated it far down their schedule.</p>
<p>For historical reasons, Britons have a different attitude towards the state than Germans or Americans. For the majority on this island their inert complacency continues, happy in their own ignorance not to question the guiding hand of authority; but there is a genuine debate amongst the intelligentsia reflected in the ideas and opinions bounced across social media and blogs.</p>

</figure>
<p>The first major national event to bring together these voices was the <a href="https://www.dontspyonus.org.uk/day-of-action" class="underline" rel="external">Don’t Spy On Us: Day of Action</a> in east London at the beginning of June. On the platform were journalists Cory Doctorow, Ewen MacAskill and Alan Rusbridger, technologists Bruce Schneier, Ian Brown and Tom Gaffney and media personality Stephen Fry. In a reflection of the nature of the debate also in attendance were mainstream figures such as Baroness Helena Kennedy and UK Group Chairman and CEO of M&C Saatchi, Tim Duffy.</p>
<p>Sold-out in advance, the Day of Action attendees were welcomed by a short pre-recorded speech by Stephen Fry:</p>
<p class="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.disclose.tv/embed/176958" width="640" height="360" seamless scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>There were two common themes throughout the day. </p>
<p>The first was surprise from the platform at the reach and sophistication of the NSA / GCHQ spying machine despite experience in their respective fields of journalism, technology and law that streched back decades. Duncan Campbell succinctly declared: “I have to confess that while I’ve been reporting on surveillance for 30 years now, I’ve been too cautious.”</p>
<p>The other common recurring topic was how to reach out to the many Britons who don’t consider this an important issue. Any successful campaign tactic will be one that can connect the omnipresent hidden electronic eye to its impact on people’s daily lives. The angry reaction to the Millie Dowler phone hacking saga proves that malicious surveillance can become a hot issue.</p>
<h4>Cory Doctorow</h4>
<p>For the first speaker, Cory Doctorow, the structure of the web facilities both cooperation and communication amongst the mass of the people and, in tandem, allows the exploitation by malevolent parties of the same populace. The balance is shifted to the latter through national and international law shaped by the corporate interests that demand a closed, regulated cyberspace so as to monopolise their power at the expense of privacy and innovation.</p>
<p>While the public / private axis of evil is well documented, non-aligned web regulatory bodies have also unnessarily acquiesced to commercial demands for special treatment.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium, commonly known as the W3C, have surprised many by allowing Digital Rights Management (DRM) to become part of web standards. This digital lock-in, coming to a browser near you soon, is the nemesis of open source and the public domain which the web has been built on, allowing it to bloom into todays one thousand flowers.</p>
<p>If web standards are not easily accessible to everybody, they become the preserve of special interests who are willfully ignorant to the long-term damage they will inflict on the common good as they pursue their own aims.</p>
<p>But hope, for Doctorow, lies in the proles. He extolls our willingness to use the web as tool for social progress, and he sees a cultural shift towards the privacy that will price the secret state out of mass surveillance:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It costs the NSA and GCHQ less than a penny to add somebody to their surveillance dragnets. If the bill for each spied upon person was a $10k cost then mass surveillance would be a thing of the past. Spies would have to limit their spying to those that they had a damned good reason to want to spy on. So it is our job to see that the technical, legal and commercial obstacles on the ground raise the cost of spying to that level. Whether you are a lawyer or a lawmaker, a business person or a customer, a toolmaker or a tool user, it is incumbent on you and every one all of us to make the cost of spying as high as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="image-container"><img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/alan-rusbridge-dont-spy-on-us.jpg" alt="Guardian Editor Alan Rusbridge">

</figure>
<h4>Alan Rusbridger and Ewen MacAskill</h4>
<p>The British state is not averse to using violence against dissenters, but it does not need to resort to the routine use of the bludgeon like a Middle Eastern Baathist. It cleverly co-ops its critics, showing them enough glittering delights and New Years Honours medals to bloat their egos and bring them into the fold.</p>
<p>One can only speculate at their disappointment towards <em>Guardian</em> editor Alan Rusbridger. Born in Northern Rhodesia, he was a son of the Empire and later a Cambridge undergraduate. Rather than taking a path in life that would have ended up with him taking tea at the Ritz before collecting his Order of the British Empire on bended knee, he’s become a refusenik that doesn’t play their game. “You’ve had your fun”, they informed him at one point as they heaped on the pressure to halt more secret service exposés.</p>
<p>His quiet demeanor, evident on the stage at Day of Action, belies the steel needed to steer a ship in one of the biggest political storms of our era. Not only did he fend off an angry establishment, but he also had to pacify fraught nerves and conflict amongst his own staff.</p>
<p>In his conversation with Donmar Artistic Director Josie Rourke, he gave special attention to his disappointment at the lack of support from the British political class. The Lib Dems, corrupted by power, have remained outside of the debate, while Labour have long given up being a party of principle.</p>
<p>He also contrasted the freedom that the US press has in these circumstances to the vulnerability of British newspapers that lack the protection of a constitution guaranteeing fundamental democratic rights.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, and not just from Alan Rusbridger, there was much berating of parliament and British law, in particular the absence of a British constitution to safeguard both press freedom and individual privacy rights. This has been the <em>bête noire</em> of British liberals for decades, but the institutions of the secret state, as the Snowden leaks proved, set their own agenda regardless of national laws.</p>
<p>There is a state within a state that creates its own moral and legal framework. In Britain they may not be answerable to Parliament, but in the US when they are required to give account to legislators they lie, on record, about their activity.</p>
<p>The contributions from Alan Rusbridger and Ewen MacAskill from the platform helped to clarify some points that Glenn Greenwald focused on in his book, <em>No Place To Hide</em>.</p>
<p>The first was on the destruction, at the behest of GCHQ, of the hardware at the <em>Guardian</em> office that held a copy of the leaked documents.</p>
<p>Greenwald wrote that,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... it is stunning that a revered newspaper would voluntarily, meekly, submit to such orders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>... the act of destroying the materials that a source had risked his liberty and even life to reveal was utterly antithetical to the purpose of journalism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MacAskill, in defence the <em>Guardian’s</em> action, retorted that totally blackballing the British state would have meant being legally tied up in court for years, stalling further reporting on the subject.</p>
<p>The second point of Greenwald’s ire was the handing of a copy of the documents to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>Ewen MacAskill revealed to the audience that the US office of the <em>Guardian</em> was not legally safe from British government interference, therefore for a number of months the <em>Guardian’s</em> journalists working on the story had their own specially constructed room inside the building of the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that these events caused a fatal schism between the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper and Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, with the later declaring “I will never trust them again”.</p>
<p>The reporting of this story, initially delivering consistent knockout frontpage revelations, has stalled; with the lost momentum lessening its impact in 2014 despite thousands of documents yet to be revealed.</p>
<h4>Duncan Campbell</h4>
<p>Duncan Campbell is as fearless an investigative reporter one could ever meet, which on one occasion landed him in Brixton prison for four days amongst “murderers and rapists” after being charged under the Official Secrets Act 1911.</p>
<p>His contribution was an honest appraisal of the effects of state snooping on open journalism.</p>
<p>For Campbell, the consequence of living in a surveillance state has the same effect as Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You don’t need the jackboot on the streets to stop what happens in the press if you can place the jackboot in the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the panopticon, they are not always watching and Campbell warns against over-cautious mindset amongst journalists who are always fearful of GHCQ “locked up in Cheltenham with their fancy toys and their inflated sense of self-importance”.</p>

<h4>A summary</h4>
<p>Absent from the reporting and debate over the past year has been the lack of historical context to the Snowden leaks. Sadly, this was also absent from the Day of Action. </p>
<p>We are not in a unique era of manipulative state surveillance, and the only person to make reference to past practices was Wikipedia’s Jimmy Wales who noted that the British trade unions were once at the receiving end of covert state monitoring and harassment.</p>
<p>One annoying aspect of the contributions from the platform was the derogatory term “nerds” being applied to programmers. This is a lazy, blanket caricature of a multifaceted industry whose participants are as diverse as any other modern profession. You do not build a coalition on the basis of snide remarks.</p>
<p>Perhaps the point that should have been made is that if the programmers creating privacy-protecting software have an insular outlook then they need to become more political because their software on its own is not the solution, just part of it. </p>
<p>On the whole though I was surprised by the positivity of the event. Considering the power of our opponents, it would be understandable if we all just gave up and lied down quietly in a darkened room. But there was plethora of campaigning ideas being discussed, with recognition that this is a long-term fight on multiple fronts.</p>
<p>I will allow Duncan Campbell to sum up the spirit of the day:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Snowden is our D-Day. It’s a wake up call for liberty</p>
</blockquote>

Transcript of Cory Doctorow’s speech at Don't Spy On Us Day of Action, London, June 7

Cory Doctorow

Surveillance


<p>“Our computers, which have microphones and cameras, can see us; they can hear us; they accompany us to the bathroom, they accompany us to the bedroom. They know where we are all the time, they know who are friends are and what our friends say to us. They can clean out our bank accounts and they can sabotage our careers and interfere with personal relationships.</p>

<p>“Nerds understood how powerful computers are and how dangerous they can be and so nerds developed tools that they use to be secure. But for a year now there has been a ballooning number of non-nerds who have an appreciation of what is at stake and we are finally seeing a demand for privacy tools from everyday people. </p>

<p>“Which is great news even if you are a nerd, even if you are using every one of these tools, and you don’t use Gmail and you wouldn’t touch Facebook with a ten foot barge pole. It doesn’t matter because if all your mates are Gmail users then you are a Gmail user too because all your emails end up in their inbox when you send it. And it doesn’t matter if you are not a Facebook user because if all your mates are tagging away on their pictures then you are on Facebook too.</p>

<p>“The internet is a fixture in our lives and it’s time to stop debating over whether or not the  internet makes you more free or less free. It’s clear that the internet is well suited to be either of one of these. The question today is the challenge: how do we amplify the parts of the internet that makes us free and dampen the parts that take our freedom away?</p>

<p>“Ross Anderson at Cambridge had a very important paper published last month called <em>Privacy versus government surveillance: where network effects meet public choice</em>. He describes the weird economics of networks and how it impacts on privacy. Our networks were built to be robust and resilient; to be decentralised and not have bottlenecks and single points of failure where somebody can take out a whole nations internet access. But over and over again throughout the history of networks and computers we see centralisation as a recurring tendency.</p>

<p>“Centralisation is one of the key factors that makes surveillance possible. GCHQ can’t bribe or threat millions of companies into letting them have access into their data centres, but as we learned this week they can get a considerable fraction of the worlds communication just by bribing two companies, BT and Vodaphone, to help them tap into a few centralised undersea cables.</p>

<p>“Now Ross proposed that the centralisation is down to two factors. The first is the network effect and the fact that as more people use the network the more valuable it becomes. So networks that are a little bigger than the others tend to become much bigger very quickly. If you have one fax machine then it isn’t much use but when you have more fax machines they become more useful until they become indispensable and suddenly fax machines are everywhere.</p>

<p>“But the network is accelerated by something called lock-in. When the companies set up their systems they made sure that you can’t switch to a competitor without it costing you more than you save by staying with the same product. And that might be something like designing your Playstation so it can’t run games on an Xbox, or designing a mobile phone that is locked to a particular carrier so you can’t take it with you when your contract runs out.</p>

<p>“Lock-in means that once a company starts to rig the market it can rig the game so that it never losses and it grows and grows. </p>

<p>“And a lock-in is a bit weird from a technical perspective because a lock-in is not that hard to defeat, technologically speaking. For a lock-in to work you need to have a computer that is capable of disobeying its owner. You say to the computer, Let me run this game; and the computer says, I can’t let you do that, Dave. For the “I can’t let you do that Dave” programme to work it has to be somewhere on your computer, it has to be somewhere on your hard drive. In theory you could just drag it into the trash.</p>

<p>“And many factors go into hiding the Hal 9000 app on your computer, but lots of programmers who are much smarter than you and have the same computer and are in the same situation will become bored enough to write an app and release a set of instructions for deleting Hal 9000. </p>

<p>“So we have a means of protecting ourselves on a technical level but global networks are laws. In 1996 the United Nations passed a treaty which became in the US the Millennium Copyright Act and all over the world they have adopted these models in keeping with this treaty that protect the Hal 9000 programmes.</p>

<p>“They made it a crime to remove digital locks even from your own computer, even if you are not breaking any other laws. And they would make it a crime to tell people information that would help them remove a digital lock.</p>

<p>“Now this is a very powerful force for lock-in. But the relationship between digital locks (or as it is sometimes called Digital Rights Management or DRM) and surveillance is much more direct than just this lock-in effect. Because the way you get malicious spyware onto someones computer is by exploiting a bug in the software and it is against the law to report bugs in software that acts as a digital lock because those bugs could be used to remove the digital rights software.</p>

<p>“So it is against the law to tell people that they have a flaw in their DRM which prevents them from running a Playstation game or switching carriers because that flaw might help them do it but it is also the place where you insert the spyware. </p>

<p>“For many of us the most shocking revelation in the Snowden documents was not the scale of the spying but the scale of the sabotage done in the name of spying. The NSA and GCHQ had been spending £250m a year on programmes called BULLRUN in the United States and EDGEHILL here in the UK, through which they sabotage the security of everyday technologies from standards in cryptography all the way to operating systems and communication apps that you use everyday.</p>

<p>“Now the sabotage tools were built on the basis that they would only be used by the good guys and not by the bad guys. The NSA called them “no buts”: nobody can use them but us. Which is rubbish. Exploits described by the National Security Agency have been independently recreated by security experts and we also have to assume that they have been independently created by crooks who are merrily dancing through your bank account right now.</p>

<p>“Which means your digital life - which means your whole life these days because everything you do today involves the internet and everything you do tomorrow will require the internet - your digital life is being made deliberately vulnerable to every spy, crook, identity thief, gangster, pervert and voyeur on the internet which is all of them because everybody is on the internet. </p>

<p>“The entertainment industry is stepping up its efforts to demand digital locks everywhere. They want to make sure that if we watch a Netflix movie we can’t save it to the hard drive, and or when you are using the iPlayer you can’t watch a show for more than 7 days. So taking their case to the standards body that oversees the web, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, they demanded that this will be made standard for the web itself; which is to say, they demanded that everything that has a browser-based interface has to be designed to disobey its owner using software that’s illegal to research and describe flaws in; meaning that everything that uses a browser is about to become a reservoir of vulnerabilities sitting there waiting to be used by the NSA, GCHQ, foreign spies, extortionists, criminals and crooks.</p>

<p>“And the worst of it is that the W3C has said that they are going to do it. So I have a challenge for them: Don’t leave our browsers, our phones, our cars, our homes, our appliances vulnerable to spies and crooks. If you must standardise Digital Rights Management at the W3C, then at least follow the lead that you yourself set back when you were discussing software patents on the web. Because when the World Wide Web Consortium first started back in the early days of the web there were companies all around getting silly software patents on things that were key to the web. They would go to the standards bodies and say, We think that this should be the standard way the web runs so every time somebody uses a browser and every time somebody serves a web page we get a faction of a penny. And the World Wide Web Consortium said, Look it is not our business to adjudicate whether software patents are good or bad or whether your patent is good or bad, we are in the business making standards anybody can implement without legal jeopardy, without having to pay a fee. So the deal is that if you come to us to make a standard you have to promise not to sue people who practice your patents in the process of following that standard.</p>

<p>“That is the condition in make a standard you have to do everything in your power to make that standard usable by everyone. </p>

<p>“And it is easy to see how they could apply that to digital rights framework. They could say to the BBC, they could say to Netflix, yes we can standardise patent technology, we don’t take a position on whether patent technology is right or wrong but you have to promise us as a condition of your participation: you have to sign a covenant saying that you won’t sue people who implement our standard and you won’t sue people who talk about vulnerabilities in the standard because we are in the business of making a web that people want and the web that people want is a web where you don’t get sued for making web stuff and you don’t get sued for telling people the ways that that web can attack them.</p>

<p>“But the W3C is just a patsy. It is companies like Netflix and the BBC that are driving for DRM to be added to all new technologies and the most ironic part is they don’t even care that this has any nexus with spying on us. The reason they want this out there is they want to make sure we watch telly the right way and the fact that their preferred method of telly watching opens us up to mass surveillance is neither here nor there but if we let them do it we are hustling our way into the full Orwell.</p>

<p>“It looks grim but I have hope because the thing the internet does better than anything else is let us co-operate with each other to make stuff and get stuff done. Think of Kickstarter and all that is has enabled and how we might apply that to something like politics.</p>

<p>“Take the Greens for example. I live around here and the local safe-seat Labour candidate is the architect of the ID card and she wins every election, but if you look at the actual numbers then the Greens, the minority party, always come in second. And it’s easy to see why they come in second because nobody wants to vote for a candidate that can’t possibly win. But imagine that if you are the great door bell ringer and you knocked on my door and instead of saying, I’m here to convince you to waste your vote on somebody that has no hope of winning; he could say, All I want you to do is register on this website that you will vote for this minority candidate if 10,000 of your neighbours sign up and vote for her too. All of a sudden you would get alternative voting without having to worry about the referendum. All of a sudden you have a means by which people can join forces to take on someone with a seemingly unstoppable encumbrancy and overturn it. </p>

<p>“You could apply it to fracking, people who fight fracking around their homes. Instead of everybody spending a thousand pounds mitigating flaming water coming out of the fossetts, they all agree that they are going to put their money together and pool it on a website where they advertise for any solicitor who agrees to reduce the fracking firms to penury as long as 10,000 of their neighbour agree to do the same.</p>

<p>“And once all those pledges are there for the solicitors to see you will have QCs begging to represent them against the biggest firms in the country.</p>

<p>“Almost every form of corruption, from surveillance, to pollution, to bogus clinical trials that have the NHS spending hundreds of millions are a result from an in-balance in externalities. The polluter, ATOS, BT surveillance arm make a little profit by dumping all the crap on us and it costs us much more to clean up the resulting mess. But that cost is diffused amongst all the victims and the perpetrators get a tiny profit which they can turn around and use to support parliament to make rules so that their profits can grow. The internet lets us reverse that dynamic, it has the power to force governments to be accountable to their people. With a free and open internet, equipped with the cryptographic tools that let anybody talk to anybody else without being spied on we can win this fight and the fights that are to come.</p>

<p>“It costs the NSA and GCHQ less than a penny to add somebody to their surveillance dragnets. If the bill for each spied upon person was a $10k cost then mass surveillance would be a thing of the past. Spies would have to limit their spying to those that they had a damned good reason to want to spy on. So it is our job to see to that that the technical, legal and commercial obstacles on the ground raise the cost of spying to that level. Whether you are a lawyer or a lawmaker, a business person or a customer, a toolmaker or a tool user, it is incumbent on you and every one all of us to make the cost of spying as high as possible.”</p>

An easy way of stopping spam using AngularJS

<p>Anti-spam algorithms are complex and not easily replicated in your own code, but there is a simple way of stopping most spam created by bots. It’s an approach I’ve used successfully for years and ported to AngularJS when building this blog.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TCotton/portfolio/blob/master/app/blog-comments/comment.html" class="underline" rel="external">Here on my GitHub account</a> you will see the HTML form that I use for comments. There’s nothing unusual about it. It utilises AngularJS form markup to ensure that a name, email address and message are entered.</p>

<p>The anti-spam trick is here:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;span class="hide"&gt
&lt;label for="zipcode" class="hide"&gtYour zipcode&lt;/label&gt
&lt;input type="text" id="zipcode" value="" data-ng-pattern="zipRegex" data-ng-model="commentFormData.zipcode" class="hide"/&gt
&lt;/span&gt
</code>
</pre>

<p>The regex pattern is in the controller:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
$scope.zipRegex = /(?!.*)/;
</code>
</pre>

<p>Any character entered into the zipcode field will prevent the form from being submitted.</p>

<p>It is hidden with a CSS display value of none.</p>

<p>And that’s it! As a first line of defence it’s a workable, easy-to-implement, user-friendly (no CAPTCHAs!) approach.</p>

Using prototypal inheritance for AngularJS controllers and services

AngularJS


<p>As AngularJS matures and is used on bigger projects, the advice on best practices at scale proliferates.</p>

<p>Most programmers find that their first projects using AngularJS were written with messy codebases. Although AngularJS is JavaScript, it’s almost akin to learning a new language. The learning curve is a non-linear ascent path scattered with unexpected obstacles. Nathan LeClaire nails the experience with <a href="http://nathanleclaire.com/blog/2014/01/04/5-smooth-angularjs-application-tips/" class="underline" rel="external">this diagram</a>:</p>

<p class="image-container"><img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/js-learning-curves.jpeg" alt="angularjs learning curve" /></p>

<p>Here are three ideas about AngularJS best practices:</p>

<h4>1. Avoid using scope to pass around data</h4>

<p>With <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$emit" class="underline" rel="external">$emit</a> to pass data downwards to all child scopes and <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$broadcast" class="underline" rel="external">$broadcast</a> to pass data upwards, AngularJS has core inbuilt features that allow data to be passed in a similar way as DOM event bubbling and capturing.</p>

<p>The same is true for <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$watch" class="underline" rel="external">$watch</a> that takes advantage of Angular’s feature of passing data down from the $rootScope or parent controller to child scopes.</p>

<p>The argument against relying on these methods is that it tightly couples controllers together, causing potential TDD issues and performance concerns.</p>

<p>A couple of articles that highlight the potential downside of using this coding practice can be found in <a href="http://www.benlesh.com/2013/10/title.html" class="underline" rel="external">Angular JS - You probably shouldn't use $watch in your controllers</a> by Ben Lesh and <a href="http://www.technofattie.com/2014/03/21/five-guidelines-for-avoiding-scope-soup-in-angular.html" class="underline" rel="external">5 Guidelines For Avoiding Scope Soup in Angular</a> by Josh Carroll (Both articles focus on avoiding $watch rather than $emit or $broadcast).</p>

<p><strong>My opinion</strong>: Passing data around with scope should be avoided wherever possible but be mindful that this isn’t a hack but a inbuilt core feature of AngularJS. If you feel that that circumstances dictate its need, then pass data through the scope.</p>

<h4>2. Avoid two-way binding</h4>

<p>One of the key moments of understanding how AngularJS works is when examining the performance of your code with the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk?hl=en" class="underline" rel="external">Batarang Chrome extension</a>: "What, typing in an input field results in Angular reassessing all data-models on the entire page?!"</p>

<p>Welcome to dirty checking and digest loop! For those not familiar with this core AngularJS feature <a href="https://www.ng-book.com/p/The-Digest-Loop-and-apply/" class="underline" rel="external">read the relevant chapter of the Ng-Book</a>.</p>

<p>It is claimed that AngularJS dirty checking is efficient. I disagree, depending on the size of your project it can be a noticeable performance issue. This problem will be addressed when <a href="http://amasad.me/2014/03/16/why-im-excited-about-objectobserve/" class="underline" rel="external">Object.observe</a> is fully implemented across browsers.</p>

<p>To assist with minimising two-way binding there is <a href="https://github.com/Pasvaz/bindonce" class="underline" rel="external">Pasquale Vazzana’s bindonce library</a>.</p>

<p>The last big project I worked on used the bindonce library.</p>

<p>Using Chrome dev tools timeline to monitor FPS and memory, it was possible to observe how bindonce resulted in a positive performance improvement.</p>

<p>I used Batarang to monitor the number of watch expressions over a two month period. We used the same number at the end of this time then as at the beginning, but when closely examining the saved JSON results it was evident that although we were removing watches with bindonce we were also, due to the complexity of the project, (necessarily) adding them elsewhere. Using bindonce kept the total number static.</p>

<p>Two possible alternative approaches to bindonce are <a href="http://www.technofattie.com/2014/03/21/five-guidelines-for-avoiding-scope-soup-in-angular.html" class="underline" rel="external">using ng-change on input values</a> or <a href="http://tech.small-improvements.com/2013/09/10/angularjs-performance-with-large-lists/" class="underline" rel="external">using traditional JavaScript event handling instead of AngularJS directives</a>.</p>

<p><strong>My opinion:</strong> Don’t use bindonce as a matter of routine. Wait first until you have a performance issue then experiment with the library assessing its impact by using Google Chrome Dev tools.</p>

<h4>3. Use constructor functions</h4>

<p>A much Tweeted article at the beginning of the year was Ben Lesh’s <a href="http://www.technofattie.com/2014/03/21/five-guidelines-for-avoiding-scope-soup-in-angular.html" class="underline" rel="external">5 Guidelines For Avoiding Scope Soup in Angular</a>. One argument he makes is using a “class-based” approach to controllers.</p>

<p>My early AngularJS code resembled a messy loopy lou playschool language. Coding this blog gave me an opportunity to experiment with a different design.</p>

<p>Here is Ben’s controller and underneath is the structure of my controller. Afterwards I’ll explain the code in more detail.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
(function(){

  var Ctrl = function(aService, $timeout) {
    this.aService = aService;
    this.$timeout = $timeout;
  };

  Ctrl.prototype.aMethod = function(){

  };

  Ctrl.$inject = ['aService', '$timeout'];

  app.controller('Ctrl', Ctrl);

}());
</code>
</pre>

<p>---------</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
(function () {

  /** Declare function variable names
   * **/
  var _createContentSnippet;

  var Ctrl = function (aService, $timeout, $rootScope, $scope) {

    /** angular services
     * **/
    this.$timeout = $timeout;
    this.$timeout = $rootScope;

    /** injected application services
     * **/
    Object.defineProperty(this, 'aService', {
      enumerable: false,
      configurable: false,
      writable: false,
      value: aService
    });

    /** Functions that act as private methods
     * */
    _createContentSnippet = function () {

    }.bind(this);

  };


  /** Public methods
   * **/
  Ctrl.prototype.aMethod = function () {

  };

  /** Inject services
   * **/
  Ctrl.$inject = ['aService', '$timeout', '$scope', '$rootScope'];

  app.controller('Ctrl', Ctrl);

}());
</code>
</pre>

<p>AngularJS is very opinionated but it does allow you to create controllers by using constructor functions.</p>

<p>You have to associate it to a route when using $routeProvider:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
.when('blog-page', {
        templateUrl: 'views/blog.html',
        controller: 'Ctrl as BlogCtrl'
      })
</code>
</pre>

<p>And in the HTML template use the copy of the object with the required method:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;form novalidate="novalidate" name="commentForm" data-ng-submit="BlogCtrl'.submitContactForm(commentForm.$valid)"&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>You can view a more detailed example on my GitHub account: <a href="https://github.com/TCotton/portfolio/blob/master/app/blog-comments/comment_controller.js" class="underline" rel="external">this is a controller I created for blog comments</a>.</p>

<p>Discussion about JavaScript code organisation best practices predates AngularJS by many, many years. Perhaps the first person to seriously tackle the subject was Douglas Crockford, but there have been several books and countless blog articles published on the subject since.</p>

<p>A problem using constructor functions is the inability to create private methods. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/TCotton/9870885" class="underline" rel="external">module pattern</a> uses closures but a similar approach here is not possible because everything attached to the currently executed code (as properties of the <em>this</em> keyword) is exposed to the template.</p>

<p>This is apparent if you try to create a private method and then examine the models using the Batarang Chrome extension:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript”>
<code>
var Ctrl = function () {

    /** Nope
     * **/
    this.aPrivateMethod = function () {

    };

    /** Nope, again
     * **/
    this.anotherPrivateMethod = function () {
        return anotherPrivateMethod();
    };

    var anotherPrivateMethod = function () {

    };

};
</code>
</pre>

<p>My solution was to take advantage of JavaScript scope and declare the variable name at the top of the script. This means that a local function created inside the constructor function can be used in two places: in the constructor function itself and in the public methods.</p>

<p>Accessing the bind method on the local functions allows the constructor scope to be used.</p>

<p>Exposing all the properties to the template is not necessarily a bad practice that will lead to catastrophic results, but if there is no intention of using this data in the template I’d rather it was contained within the constructor. </p>

<p>Using EMCAScript 5 objects and properties will help here.</p>

<p>Considering they have been around a few years, they are surprisingly little used by JavaScript developers. This is probably because of the lack of cross-browser support in IE8 and below, or concerns around performance.</p>

<p>In recent times performance issues have been somewhat addressed by the evergreen browsers, and if you have no concern for IE8 support, it is worth using the benefits that the new features of EMCAScript 5 provide.</p>

<p>Adding properties to a constructor function the old way means no permissions are set:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var Ctrl = function (aService) {

     this.aService = aService;

};
</code>
</pre>

<p>It is possible to delete or change the property or value.</p>

<p>With EMCAScript 5 Object.defineProperty it is the reverse:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var Ctrl = function (aService) {

     Object.defineProperty(this, 'aService', {
         value: aService
     });

};
</code>
</pre>

<p>The Object.defineProperty default is to make the property non-writable, non-configurable and non-enumerable.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
Object.defineProperty(this, 'aService', {
    enumerable: false,
    configurable: false,
    writable: false,
    value: aService
});
</code>
</pre>

<p>Permissions are given on a needs basis. Preventing the property from being enumerable will stop it being exposed to the template.</p>

<p>There’s isn’t even a need to inject the $scope object.</p>

<p>Both the code examples below assign values to a data-model:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var Ctrl = function ($scope) {

    this.$scope = $scope;
    this.$scope.formInput = 'A form field';
    this.$scope.anotherFormInput = 'Another form input';

};
</code>
</pre>

<p>---------</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var Ctrl = function () {

    this.formInput = 'A form field';
    this.anotherFormInput = 'Another form input';

};
</code>
</pre>

<p>However, for the sake of readability I used the $scope object.</p>

<p>Although it is possible to use the bind method you will quickly run into TDD and SEO problems. This is because PhantomJs <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/10522#issuecomment-16241501" class="underline" rel="external">does not support this EMCAScript 5 feature</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We never intended this to happen. PhantomJS relies on QtWebKit in Qt and the last stable version of Qt (which has updated QtWebKit) was slow to emerge (for a lot of technical and non-technical reasons).</p>

<p>We already tried some attempts to rectify the situation. Unfortunately it's a lot of work and all the combined spare-time of our contributors is not enough to bring the solution to the table.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recommended solutions include using underscore.js _.bind() or one of the two polyfills to be found on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind" class="underline" rel="external">Mozilla bind() page</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/10522#issuecomment-39248521" class="underline" rel="external">poly version</a> respectively.</p>

<p>I swapped PhantomJs for Chrome when TTD testing and, where necessary, substituted bind() for copying the <em>this</em> keyword into local scope.</p>

<p><strong>My opinion:</strong> I’m not convinced that using constructor functions is the right approach for AngularJS. I’m concerned about the memory implications for adding both AngularJS and the application services as properties of the constructor function. </p>

<p>Creating private methods that are not exposed to the template is particularly challenging, and the greater the difficulty the more complex the code.</p>

<p>There isn’t a single right way of organising your code in controllers and services. It’s a matter of assessing the pros and cons of the different approaches, and then concluding which pattern(s) is, on the whole, the most beneficial to use.</p>

CSS only tooltip to reveal URL of external link on mouseover

CSS

<p>There are dozens of tutorials on the web for creating CSS-only tooltips. For this blog I used CSS to display the full URL of a link when the user hovers over the link text.</p>

<p>The code is below. Afterwards I’ll explain it in detail:</p>

<pre>
[rel="external"]::after {
  content: " " attr(href) " ";
  position: absolute;
  left: 20%;
  bottom: 100%;
  color: white;
  background: #666666;
  padding: 1px 5px;
  opacity: 0;
  -ms-transition: opacity 0.5s;
  -webkit-transition: opacity 0.5s;
  transition: opacity 0.5s;
  white-space: nowrap;
  pointer-events: none;
}

[rel="external"]:hover::after {
  opacity: 1;
  pointer-events: auto;
}
</pre>

<p>I’ve used the rel attribute with a value of external but it can be a class.</p>

<p>A pseudo-element is used with the href attribute for content. Absolute positioning visually places the URL on the top right-hand side of the text, and the use of CSS3 animation allows the link to gently appear.</p>

<p>To prevent the URL from breaking into two I have set the white-space property value to nowrap.</p>

<p>The link is hidden with opacity set to zero.</p>

<p>To prevent any possible collision with text on the line above, the default pointer-events value is none; changing to auto on hover.</p>

<p>The use of nowrap was causing layout issues on handheld devices so display is set to none on non-desktop screens, but as hover is a handheld link state this doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>To see demonstrations of this code use your mouse to hover over the following UK national newspapers: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk" rel="external" class="underline">Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" rel="external" class="underline">The Times</a>, <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/" rel="external" class="underline">Telegraph</a>.</p>

Fear technology?

<p>There is an advert currently appearing on British TV for Hive – a means of controlling your heating remotely through a phone app:</p>

<p><div class="video-container"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/k-MRkC5DqFQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p>It's an annoying and abstract advert for the current tech fetish of “The Internet of Things” (IoT). This is a term for connecting all household devices to the web: fridges, TVs, lighting and central heating. IoT could, potentially, be used for any electrical device in the home.</p>

<p>My first thought was, Why would I need to remotely control my heating from a smartphone app? I can turn the heating off when I leave my home and turn it on when I return, or just use a timer which has for decades proven to be adequate way for households to control heating and hot water.</p>

<p>How does the consumer benefit from this?  Or does the real gain go to the company (in this case British Gas) promoting the device? If IoT ends up storing data on all household devices then how and what this data is used for seems to be an aspect of this technology <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/hive-review-a-tentative-foray-into-the-internet-of-things-by-british-gas-is-convincing-9143953.html" rel="external" class="underline">few mainstream commentators are probing</a>. IoT could prove to be a frighteningly accurate reflection on an individual's life which could be sold on to third parties, accumulated by government departments or leaked after a malicious attack.</p>

<p>A comparison can be made to store loyalty cards which provide small financial benefits to the card user, but give far greater monetary return to the store who use this data to both target the individual shopper more accurately and as part of a wider pool of marketing statistical data.</p>

<p>Companies are eager for details of consumer behaviour. But if it is in the companies best interest, the financial benefits will be minimal to the consumer. Or outright harmful in other ways. All aspects of our life will be detailed in minutiae. We are in danger of losing the last vestiges of privacy that the digital economy has almost destroyed.</p>

<h4 id="rise">The rise of a digital world – a personal reflection</h4>

<p>I smile wryly when I read of some programmer reflect on their first adolescent forays into coding through the first generation of mass produced home computers such as the ZX Spectrum or Commodore 64. Technology historians and enthusiasts widely praise these computers as bringing affordable computing into everyday households in the 80s.</p>

<p>This may have been the case for the middle classes, but not for the poor. My family couldn't afford a computer in the '80s. In the days before readily available credit, if you couldn't afford something then you didn't buy it. We didn't own a computer and nor did anybody else we knew.</p>

<p>At the comprehensive school I attended you could take a GCSE in Compute Science. The computers used were BBC Micro’s and the teacher was an elderly gentleman with a pronounced, clipped accent. At the time I didn't see the relevance programming had to my current life or future work prospects.</p>

<p>School was the most uninspiring experience in my life and at 16 I rushed straight into work. Later, when I returned to studying, any word longer than 6 letters was a mystery and I had to teach myself the fundamentals of English grammar that I should have learnt at school (“Mum, I think I'm dyslexic”, “Don't be daft you didn't pay any attention in class”).</p>

<p>Working as a printer on an Heidelberg MO, I failed to realise the way that technology was destroying this industrial sector. Declining from the '80s onwards, printing, once the most prestigious of working class jobs, has now been reduced to a rump sunset industry. Working class boys don't aspire to work in the print just as they don't plan to work on the docks (in east London these were the two most sought after jobs).</p>

<p>In the company office a salesman was constantly recharging a new mobile phone on his desk. It was positioned prominently for everybody to see. He was making a statement about his own personal affluence: <em>I can afford a mobile phone</em>.</p>

<p>Technology was not for the likes of us: it was for <em>them</em>; the middle-classes and the wealthy.</p>

<p>1997 was my first encounter with the World Wide Web. The university I attended gave us free, unlimited access. It was incredibly dull. There was no broadband  so internet speeds were ridiculously slow and, what's more, there was minimal interesting content on the nascent sites. The BBC website only offered the TV listings – information that could have been gained from buying any daily newspaper.</p>

<p>We were all given email addresses but finding no useful purpose they only served as means of passing around “funny” circulars.</p>

<p>From 1997 to 2000 I never used the web for academic research (former uni friends concur with me on this).</p>

<p>So now I had access to the internet – but no reason to use it.</p>

<h4 id="communication">The web as a tool for communication and discussion</h4>

<p>Around 2002 I became more interested in the web. This was primarily through political discussion boards. I'm still an active contributor to one of these (<a href="http://www.urban75.net/forums/" rel="external" class="underline">Urban75</a>) to this day.</p>

<p>Anonymity was the default personal setting. Everybody used handles and nobody as a rule divulged any more personal information then they felt necessary.</p>

<p>2002 was also the year I created my first website. Using Microsoft FrontPage, I put together a website for a community campaign group I was involved in. It was really awful. I'm so grateful that there is no trace of it left.</p>

<p>A couple of years later, the Web 2.0 era began. There was a lot of hyperbolic marketing nonsense with Web 2.0, but under its umbrella were blogs, social bookmarking and social media.</p>

<p>Rather than being passive readers, the web user was encouraged to engage with a website, whether that was through blog comments or rewarding an article with a Digg “thumbs up”.</p>

<p>One of the key websites from this era was YouTube. Previously, if you wanted to host videos on your own site you had to use specialist and expensive streaming servers. YouTube gave us easy access to hosting and viewing videos. YouTube is one of the most important websites in the history of the internet.</p>

<p>There was a lot of starry-eyed enthusiasm around Web 2.0, with many of us excited about how information could be shared and used through RSS feeds and APIs. Unfortunately the promise of breaking down the info barriers never materialised, with both RSS feeds and open APIs going into slow retreat in recent years.</p>

<p>But now I was fully onboard the digital train. I used a lot of my spare time creating websites and playing with code.</p>

<p>In 2008 I made a personal “career” change. I use career in quotes as I've never been career minded. Some people go through the educational conveyor belt and subsequent jobs market with clear career goals in mind. I have never been one of those. I undertook a degree in English literature and history because I liked the subjects, not because it fitted in with any employment ambitions.</p>

<p>But in 2008 I found myself as a customer care manager at a large property company. I did the job well enough, but realised I was spending about half my time researching web design and SEO. The latter was what interested me. So I decided to leave and donate all my time to creating websites. Then followed years of underemployment and unemployment as I struggled to survive. It takes a long time in this industry to accumulate the necessary knowledge and experience to be taken seriously. At the beginning of this journey all I had was an old battered PC with Microsoft XP which would regularly crash.</p>

<p>Today in 2014 I have just finished a seven month contract working at blinkboxbooks (part of the Tesco’s empire) as a front-end engineer on a full-stack JavaScript platform.</p>

<p>The web has served me well. It has given me a highly paid, interesting job. Academic qualifications have never mattered. I don't have any formal education in computer science or related fields. It's difficult to think of any other industry where this could happen. There's little room for an autodidact in the modern corporate HR gateway.</p>

<p>Talk of a digital meritocracy are overplayed, but in this industry what you were doing last year counts for more than any qualifications gained ten or twenty years ago.</p>

<p>With this though comes great pressure to stay relevant in a incredibly fast-moving industry, and which leads to <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/managing-a-mind/" rel="external" class="underline">breakdowns</a> and <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/07/make-it-count/" rel="external" class="underline">mental collapse</a>.</p>

<p>Web development isn't a job, it's a way of life.</p>

<h4 id="fear-technology">Fear technology, love technology, fear technology</h4>

<p>To recap, once a digital outsider I was now a fully paid-up member of the club. I've never been utopian in my expectations of how technology could change society for the better, but it was genuinely exciting to see how everyday people could use the web as a tool for better communication, dissent, discussion, self-improvement and to lead a more complex, richer life.</p>

<p>When I first used the web regularly I speculated that it wouldn’t last long. I expected the old corporate interests to fully dominate this new platform and turn it into a bland shopping centre experience where we are all passive, exploited consumers with limited choice.</p>

<p>This hasn't happened – not yet at least. I underestimated the technology and didn't realise how difficult it would be to exert centrally controlled power over it. I didn't anticipate the web activism that would challenge predatory corporate interests (the 2005 successful battle against EU software patents a prime example), and I certainly never envisaged the power that the new digital corporations would hold.</p>

<p>The rot has actually been less overtly obvious, with technology becoming a key tool of societal control, exploitation and the degeneration of the commons.</p>

<p class="image-container"><img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/panic-snowden-leaks.jpg" alt="keyboard with special panic key" /></p>

<h4 id="red-pill">Take the red pill</h4>

<p>For many of us the NSA / GCHQ hacking and spying activities made public by the Edward Snowden leaks have been a shock. I consider myself politically literate, and of course I presumed the secret services were, using various techniques, monitoring web activity; but the facts presented in black and white were extremely disturbing.</p>

<p>Their data collection methods include, amongst much else, sucking up contacts of personal Yahoo accounts, storing email meta data, exploiting backdoor software security holes and penetrating SSL.</p>

<p>It's common to hear concerns brushed aside with a flippant “I've haven’t anything to worry about, I've haven’t done anything wrong”. But that isn't a decision that you make about yourself – somebody else decides that about you in secret.</p>

<p>What we do know is that to become a target of state monitoring and harassment you only need the palest radical credentials through involvement in an innocuous environmental or community campaign.</p>

<p>For examples, read about the case of <a href="https://medium.com/matter/d15b5801b79e" rel="external" class="underline">John and Linda Catt</a> who were involved in anti-arms trade campaigns or 69 year-old Dr Peter Harbour, activist in that notorious Bolshevik sect, the Thrupp Lake environmental group, who was the subject of intense police monitoring (<em>Undercover: The True Story of Britain's Secret Police</em>, 2013, p.203).</p>

<p>James Bridle in a <a href="https://medium.com/matter/d15b5801b79e" rel="external" class="underline">recent article published on Matter</a>, wrote: </p>

<blockquote cite="https://medium.com/matter/d15b5801b79e"><p>Another man, who spoke to journalists but chose to remain anonymous to prevent further harassment, says he was stopped more than 25 times by police under a variety of pretences after he had attended a peaceful local protest against duck and pheasant shooting. He finally made a formal complaint after police armed with machine guns pulled him over during an evening out with his wife.</p></blockquote>

<p>As one undercover officer <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/unhappy-fact-activist-life" rel="external" class="underline">boldly declared</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/unhappy-fact-activist-life"><p>You don't have to be self-important to suspect you're the victim of state surveillance. If you're politically active, it's simply a fact of life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anton Setchell, former head or the National Co-ordinator for Domestic Extremism, has given an equally ominous statement:</p>

<blockquote cite="Undercover, p.205"><p>Just because you have no criminal record does not mean that you are not of interest to the police. Everyone who has got a criminal record did not have one once (<em>Undercover</em>, p.205)</p></blockquote>

<p>To the police, these individuals and groups are targeted under the alarmist banner of “domestic extremists” or “domestic terrorists” (labels with no legal basis).</p>

<p>Unease and distrust towards democracy has long been a feature of the British establishment, and they have fully embraced the new breed of sophisticated tools regardless of the ethical implications.</p>

<p>In the fallout of the Snowden leaks there is now a scramble by online activists and engineers to create a new generation of software and hardware that has privacy at its core: <a href="https://tox.im/" rel="external" class="underline">Tox</a>, an alternative to Skype; <a href="https://www.blackphone.ch/" rel="external" class="underline">Blackphone</a>, a security-centred Android smartphone; and <a href="http://twister.net.co/" rel="external" class="underline">Twister</a>, a “fully decentralized P2P microblogging platform leveraging from the free software implementations of Bitcoin and BitTorrent protocols”. </p>

<p>But, at its heart, this is a political fight; which is why I am now a member of the <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/" rel="external" class="underline">Open Rights Group</a></p>

<p class="image-container"><img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/cctv.jpg" alt="CCTV in front of Big Ben" /></p>

<h4 id="sky">The eye in the sky</h4>

<p>Living in London, CCTV is a ubiquitous presence. From every street corner, public transport vehicle and roadside verge a camera points at us, both spying and collecting information on the capitals subjects (in the UK we are not citizens, but subjects of the Queen).</p>

<p>It is estimated that there are over 4 million CCTV cameras in the UK: roughly one for every 14 people; including 300,000 in schools.</p>

<p>Considering the density of cameras, the often quoted figure of the average Londoner being monitored up to 300 times every day is entirely believable.</p>

<p>Automated number plate recognition (ANPR), numbering several thousand cameras, access up to 26 million images a day. It has been reported that the archive holds over 17 billion images.</p>

<p>We are so over-populated with CCTV we now have an unsavoury international reputation:</p>

<p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">UK continues at the forefront of the surveillance state: cameras at gas pumps to deny fuel to the uninsured <a href="http://t.co/VaGxAazR">http://t.co/VaGxAazR</a></p>&mdash; Tim O&#39;Reilly (@timoreilly) <a href="https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/181094513568268288">March 17, 2012</a></blockquote>
</p>

<p>Remember, this it is not Iran, or North Korea, or Russia that O’Reilly claims is at the forefront of surveillance, but <em>the UK</em> - a democracy (although arguably a somewhat dysfunctional one).</p>

<p>On the current trajectory it is only a matter of time before facial recognition software cameras stain the London skyline and mental environment.</p>

<h4 id="jobs">Where are the jobs?</h4>

<p>It’s hard not to watch the difficulties that the music and newspapers industries have had in adapting to the new online reality with a certain amount of <em>schadenfreude</em>. Both industries, once bloated with arrogance, have now dramatically declined. I remember in the late 90s new CD album releases were priced at £18 - they were taking the piss.</p>

<p>But for every Sun or EMI, there is a <em>Camden New Journal</em> or Domino records that are under the same strain.</p>

<p>It’s not just the media and music sectors that have been affected; the economic upheaval has been as great as the rise of the Fordist mode of manufacturing 100 years ago.</p>

<p>Economists, on both the left and right, agree that digitisation is destroying jobs, and the new vocations that it has created, like web development and computer programming, represent a small fraction of that lost employment.</p>

<p>No economist predicts this to change in the short-term, some view it as irreversible.</p>

<p>At the forefront of this debate are the economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfree, authors of the recently published <em>Race Against the Machine</em>. </p>

<p>Brynjolfsson and McAfree acknowledge that rapid industrial innovation is not just a feature of the 21st century. The last 200 years has seen waves of technological advances, reducing or destroying entire industries, but creating new forms of employment in the process.</p>

<p>As drayman and farrier jobs dissipated, assembly line work created whole new cities and towns like Detroit in the US and Dagenham in the UK. In these sectors, unionisation lead to noticeable financial benefits for the mass of workers employed by the car giants.</p>

<p>The link between new technology - albeit often initially imposed at great human cost - and the increase of wealth and well-being indicators has lead many economists to see the two undisputedly bound together.</p>

<p>Today, voices are <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/why-workers-are-losing-the-war-against-machines/247278/" rel="external" class="underline">questioning this orthodoxy</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/why-workers-are-losing-the-war-against-machines/247278/"><p>At least since the followers of Ned Ludd smashed mechanized looms in 1811, workers have worried about automation destroying jobs. Economists have reassured them that new jobs would be created even as old ones were eliminated. For over 200 years, the economists were right. Despite massive automation of millions of jobs, more Americans had jobs at the end of each decade up through the end of the 20th century. However, this empirical fact conceals a dirty secret. There is no economic law that says that everyone, or even most people, automatically benefit from technological progress.</p></blockquote>

<p>Increasing inequality disparity in many parts of the Western world, and in particular the US and UK, are now part of a long-term trend. The cause of this is primarily political, but in the zeitgeist mass-automation has found enthusiastic corporate adopters, as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/27/no-joke-robots-taking-over-replace-middle-classes-automatons" rel="external" class="underline">journalist John Naughton notes</a>: </p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/27/no-joke-robots-taking-over-replace-middle-classes-automatons"><p>Do we seriously believe that an economic system that supports the massive outsourcing of jobs to low-wage countries would not jump at the opportunity of replacing expensive white-collar employees with robots that cost about $4 an hour to run, never answer back, don’t have unions and are never sick or depressed?
</p></blockquote>

<p class="image-container"><img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/facebook.jpg" alt="facebook logo" /></p>

<h4 id="monopolies">The rise of the online monopolies</h4>

<p>The Facebook appropriation of Instagram and Whatsapp for staggering amounts of money signal an end to the buccaneer spirit of early web entrepreneurism. </p>

<p>Ever since the Dot Com bubble burst at the beginning of the millennium and then the rapid rise and decline of MySpace and Bebo during the next decade, it has been presumed there was an inherent fragility to online business which made it possible for the next generation of companies to quickly fill the gap of those that fell out of fashion.</p>

<p>Now Facebook, Amazon and Google are in unassailable positions, and employ tactics as aggressive as John D Rockefeller and JP Morgan in their infamous prime to ensure they hold on to their respective monopolies - forever.</p>

<p>In Britain, Google dominates with nearly 90% of the search engine market share; while Amazon, specialising in elaborate tax avoidance schemes, have a stranglehold of the book publishing industry - they control 89% of the e-book market in the UK; and with their intention to be a one-stop shop for all products, this domineering presence will be extended to dozens of different economic sectors.</p>

<p>I’m sure even the loudest ringside capitalist cheerleaders regard monopolies as harmful to economic growth and stability. But as every month passes, these online monopolies increase their power and reach; making these titanic corporate entities even more unassailable.</p>

<p class="image-container"><img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/fear-technology-section.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="fear">Fear technology?</h4>

<p>All the areas of concern I have written about above has come into being without public debate or consent.</p>

<p>The problems I have detailed may leave the reader crying in the manner of Dad’s Army’s Fraser, 'We’re doomed! We’re doomed I tell you!'.</p>

<p>It can be tempting to conclude that we are living through an era of seismic singularity, but this is an unimaginative analysis of the institutions that dominate our lives and one that lacks any historical perspective.</p>

<p>For governments and corporations, it’s business as usual.</p>

<p class="image-container"><img src="https://andywalpole.me/images/blog-images/on-the-record.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<h4 id="on-the-record"><em>On The Record</em>, a warning from 1985</h4>

<p>Duncan Campbell is a journalist that exposed Britain’s secret security state when Glenn Greenwald was still learning to spell at school.</p>

<p>The existence of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) is a matter of record.</p>

<p>In 1976 Campbell co-authored an article for <em>Time Out</em> entitled <em>The Eavesdroppers</em> that revealed GCHQ to the public for the first time. As a way of thanks, the British authorities deported his American co-author, placed Duncan under M15 surveillance, and had Special Branch bust him a year later as he undertook further research.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of his illustrious career in investigative journalism, and the first of many confrontations with Britain’s security apparatus - not just via the medium of writing, but like the Special Branch arrest above, physically and legally too.</p>

<p><em>On The Record: Surveillance, Computers &amp; Privacy - The Inside Story…</em>, co-author by Duncan Campbell and Steve Connor, was published in 1985.</p>

<p>It is an account of the digitization of information by public bodies over the previous two decades, but it also offered a clear signpost to future technological expansion: optical pattern recognition systems, speech recognition systems and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>It is a book that is quick to offer criticism of the sponsors and abusers of Britain’s governmental computerisation:</p>

<blockquote cite="On The Record, p.23"><p>Privacy, in legislative terms, is a Home Office matter. With a few honourable exceptions, no one senior in the Home Office, be they civil servants or ministers - of either party - has ever given a damn about personal privacy (<em>On The Record</em>, p.23)</p></blockquote>

<p><em>On The Record</em> covers the full spectrum of today’s surveillance state which 30 years ago was often experimental - but the crucial point is that willingness for institutional abuse and lack of concern for the individual’s privacy was already a key feature of their implementation. </p>

<p>Number plate scanning, which I previously mentioned, was first piloted by Essex and Kent in police in 1980 and then by Hertfordshire police in 1983. </p>

<p>As the authors conclude:</p>

<blockquote cite="On The Record, p.256"><p>The automatic vehicle scanner, for which prototype hardware and software has been developed and proven, and for which a clear police rationale exists, is like to be prominent in the future development of clever systems (<em>On The Record</em>, p.256)</p></blockquote>

<p>So it has proven to be.</p>

<p>The British state’s apparatus for monitoring political dissent expanded rapidly from the 1960s onwards. Which by the time of the publication of the book amounted to two million individual records. </p>

<p>In 1974 the Home Office clarified its definition of ‘subversive activity’ as those “which threaten the safety or well-being of the State”.</p>

<p>To which the authors of <em>On The Record</em> retort:</p>

<blockquote cite="On The Record,p.260"><p>This definition, striking in its breadth, has provided a great deal of fuel for controversy. How are police officers, normally conservative individuals, meant to interpret the ‘well-being’ of the state? What is the distinction between those who seek to change government and those who ‘undermine’ it? Neither illegal plans nor violent intentions are required to come under Special Branch or Security Service surveillance.” (<em>On The Record</em>, p.260)</p></blockquote>

<p>This is still the case.</p>

<p>As early as 1977, there were plans for as many as 600,000 of the million-plus names held by Special Branch to be transferred to an online database.</p>

<p>Today, electronic systems are an equally an important a tool as any other for secret service organisational practices.</p>

<h4 id="into-tomorrow">Into tomorrow</h4>

<p>It would fair to state that the web in the 90s left both governments and corporations wrong-footed.</p>

<p>Alarmed by this new communication medium, they never developed a coherent strategy for control. This lead to some enormous business disasters like the AOL-Time Warner merger, and rudimentary security interference.</p>

<p>The last ten years has seen a reversal of tactics to create sophisticated mechanisms of control and exploitation.</p>

<p>But we haven’t created this monster - it was always there.</p>

<p>Perhaps if one is to define unique characteristics of the current era, it is the dazzling amount of data that can be harvested. They could steam open our mail but that only affected a minority of people, but now they can collate the email data of millions every day. At one time they could monitor individuals through telephone taps, but they can now hoover up webcam images <em>en masse</em>.</p>

<p>Likewise companies were engaged in sophisticated marketing in the 1980s through Acorn, but the amount of personal data available that can now be amassed is breathtaking.</p>

<p>There are very good reasons why we should fear technology, but just as it can used as a tool of commercial control and overreaching surveillance, it can just as equally be used as a means of assisting humanity to achieve its full potential.</p>

<p>Look around you, we live in an advanced cultural and technological civilisation. This was created by people. It didn’t just come into being like a force of nature. Any problems that we face are surmountable, if we have the will to do so.</p>

<p>I salute those engineers now hard at work creating the next generation of secure hardware and software programmes. But this digital arms race between the techno dissenter and their resourceful opponents is too limited in scope.</p>

<p>At the moment, most political activism is rearguard in nature, with fights against software patents in Europe (successful) to preserving net neutrality in the US (ongoing). </p>

<p>The problem with these single-issue campaigns is that they only offer a myopic view of the complete political panorama.</p>

<p>During the late 60s and early 70s, the Vietnam Veterans Against War played a leading role in US anti-war activism. Although their primary concern was changing the disastrous Vietnam foreign policy, the last clause in their manifesto acknowledged that the war they fought to stop couldn’t be taken out of context of the necessity for wider social transformation:</p>

<blockquote><p>To affirm that the membership is not only concerned with ending this war, but changing the domestic, social, political, and economic institutions that have caused and permitted the continuance of war.</p></blockquote>

<p>A single issue cannot be isolated from a wider understanding and critique of the human environment that created it.</p>

<p>Unless we at least attempt to do so, we will be fighting defensive skirmishes not a war:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>To affirm that the membership is not only concerned with ending this war against privacy, online freedom and human progress, but also changing the domestic, social, political, and economic institutions that have caused and permitted the continuance of this electronic war.</em></p></blockquote>

My CSS reset / starter kit

<p>I have been using CSS now for several years and over that time I have built up my own CSS reset that I use on every project.</p>

<p>This is in a constant state of review based on both more experience and changing browser features.</p>

<p>The current version can be <a href="https://gist.github.com/TCotton/6932337" rel="external" class="underline">found on my GitGist account</a>.</p>

<p>Below I list the sections of the reset and with my reasoning behind their use.</p>

<p>The first part is <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" class="underline" rel="external">normalize.css</a>. The <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" rel="external" class="underline">Eric Mayer reset</a> was previously the most used by CSS coders, but today Nicholas Gallagher’s reset is the front-end favourite.</p>

<p>There are some parts like the :focus pseudo-class and list items that I have changed or removed, but it stands mostly intact.</p>

<p>It is important not just to cut and paste code from elsewhere but to fully understanding what it does.</p>

<p>Never unquestionably presume that somebody else's code, no matter how widely used and respected, is correct.</p>

<p>Projects like normalize.css and the HTML5 Boilerplate are there as educational assets. They have been produced on the back of collective experience and we access them in the spirit of critical appreciation, not slavish adulation.</p>

<h4>Typography</h4>

<p>The use of font-kerning is a new addition to my CSS starter kit:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
body {
  /* only optimize text for headers due to performance issues */
  text-rendering: optimizeSpeed;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased;
  -webkit-font-kerning: auto;
  -moz-font-kerning: auto;
  font-kerning: auto;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, th, td, caption {
  font-weight: normal;
  /* just left it in the headers. Was making font less legible elsewhere */
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -webkit-font-kerning: normal;
  -moz-font-kerning: normal;
  font-kerning: normal;
  -webkit-font-feature-settings: "liga", "kern";
  -moz-font-feature-settings: "liga", "kern";
  font-feature-settings: "liga", "kern";
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Marko Dugonjic’s article, <em>The Next Stages for Web Typography</em>, in <em>Smashing Book 4</em> introduced me to these new CSS3 web typographic features.</p>

<p>Here, I have made a choice to use font kerning to create more legible headline; while body text is left to the browser implementation, which is different for Firefox and Chrome and Safari.</p>

<p>I left out the Internet Explorer prefix because this was causing layout bugs in IE10 and IE11. I need to spent time investigating what is causing this.</p>

<p>On Chrome I have found that the use of  "-webkit-font-smoothing:antialiased" can be crucial for displaying smooth looking headline fonts, but I use it on a needs basis rather than as a default.</p>

<p>From the advice of the same author I have also incorporated slightly wider letter and word spacing on retina devices:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
/* slight character and word gap of retina devices to make the text more legible */
@media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), not all, (min-resolution: 2dppx), (min-resolution: 192dpi) {
    p, li {
        letter-spacing: 0.01rem;
        word-spacing: 0.01rem;
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<h4>Box-model</h4>

<p>I would never attempt to code a responsive design site without the box-sizing value set to border-box:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
* {
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

*::before {
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

*::after {
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The benefit this brings is particularly noticeable when using relative values on form element widths.</p>

<h4>Universal placeholder :focus behaviour</h4>

<p class="line-through">The commonly used HTML5 form placeholder attribute is a beneficial user-friendly feature. </p>

<p class="line-through">On some browsers the placeholder text only disappears when the user starts typing.</p>

<p class="line-through">I prefer that it disappears on the :focus event and this can be achieved by setting the opacity to 0 on :focus:</p>

<pre class="language-css line-through">
<code>
/* make placeholder text disappear on focus */
:focus::-webkit-input-placeholder {
  opacity: 0;
}

:focus:-moz-placeholder {
  /* Firefox 18- */
  opacity: 0;
}

:focus::-moz-placeholder {
  /* Firefox 19+ */
  opacity: 0;
}

:focus:-ms-input-placeholder {
  opacity: 0;
}

:focus::input-placeholder {
  opacity: 0;
}

<p>After reading Katie Sherwin's article <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/" rel="external" class="underline">Placeholders in Form Fields Are Harmful</a> I've changed my mind about this:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Placeholder text that disappears when the cursor is placed in a form field is irritating for users navigating with the keyboard.</strong>
People using the Tab key move quickly from field to field, and they don’t stop to study the next field before tabbing to it.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Webkit form element resets</h4>

<p>I aim to set my own form styling rather than leave it to the browser UI. It’s always been the case that browsers have only allowed minimal CSS styling of form elements. Safari and Chrome are particularly enthusiastic for inbuilt UI form styling and the code below goes someway to removing this:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
input[type="number"]::-webkit-inner-spin-button, input[type="number"]::-webkit-outer-spin-button {
    height: auto;
}

input[type='search']::-webkit-search-decoration, input[type='search']::-webkit-search-cancel-button, input[type='search']::-webkit-search-results-button, input[type='search']::-webkit-search-results-decoration {
    display: none;
}

input[type=text], input[type=email], input[type=url], textarea {
    -webkit-appearance: none;
    border-radius: 0;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This code should be used with caution. For example, the following will give the appearance of non-functioning checkboxes and radio buttons:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
input, textarea {
    -webkit-appearance: none;
    border-radius: 0;
}
</code>
</pre>

<h4>Links</h4>

<p>All browsers have a default colour of blue, but I make sure all link states are initially set at the same vivid #0000FF; then, when I’m then coding, there is a vibrant visual reminder of any link states I may have forgotten to set:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
/* set colour links */

a:link {
    color: blue;
}

a:visited {
    color: blue;
}

a:focus {
    color: blue;
}

a:hover {
    color: blue;
}

a:active {
    color: blue;
}
</code>
</pre>

<h4>Accessibly hidden elements and clearfix</h4>

<p>No CSS coder needs to be reminded of the necessity of using clearfix and the visuallyhidden class was taken straight from HTML5 Boilerplate. When coding for accessibility it’s useful to be able to visually hide vital page elements like form labels if they are not a feature of the design:</p>

<pre class="language-css">
<code>
.visuallyhidden {
    border: 0;
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
    height: 1px;
    margin: -1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    padding: 0;
    position: absolute;
    width: 1px;
}

/* clearfix */
.clearfix::before, .clearfix::after {
    content: "\0020";
    display: block;
    height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.clearfix::after {
    clear: both;
}
</code>
</pre>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>As I wrote before, this CSS reset / starter kit is in constant state of flux. This is a reflection of the changing state of browser features.</p>

<p>Getting it right is essential for quickly writing quality CSS code, and in responsive design this can be as challenging as using a programming language.</p>

Using matchMedia with AngularJS for better mobile performance

<p>It’s common to see responsive design code make extensive use of CSS "display:none" when the design dictates that page elements should be hidden from tablet or mobile layouts.</p>

<p>Although using CSS achieves the design goals it is horrendous for performance because the HTML is still rendered.</p>

<p>The optimum solution would be one where it is not merely visually hidden but also absent from the DOM and no unnecessary service calls have been made.</p>

<p>With a client-side framework such as AngularJS it is possible to achieve this with the use of matchMedia - media queries for JavaScript.</p>

<p>I have used this approach a number of times and I used it again on the frontpage of this site.</p>

<p>Under the slider are five blocks of data. Only three of the five are displayed on handheld devices.</p>

<p>The template uses ng-repeat:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;span data-ng-repeat="statsBlock in stats track by $index"&gt
  &lt;header class="front-page-bottom-header" data-ng-bind-html="statsBlock.header"&gt &lt;/header&gt
  &lt;section class="front-page-bottom-text" data-ng-bind-html="statsBlock.section"&gt &lt;/section&gt
&lt;/span&gt
</code>
</pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TCotton/portfolio/blob/master/app/homepage/homepage_stats_directive.js" class="underline" rel="external">In the directive</a>, the first part of the code is a feature detection statement:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
if ($window.matchMedia) {

    var mql = $window.matchMedia('screen and (max-width: 979px)');
    mql.addListener(handleMatchMedia);
    handleMediaMatch(mql);

} else {

    scope.stats = STATS;

}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Internet Explorer 9 doesn’t support matchMedia so you will need to provide a fallback.</p>

<p>For the rest of the browsers it’s a matter of setting a value identical to CSS media queries. The example here is simple but it is possible to use all the same expressions like landscape and portrait, logical operators and comma-separated lists.</p>

<p>Next add a listener to a function</p>

<p>The matchMedia in the function returns a boolean value when the target is reached:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var handleMediaMatch = function (mql) {

    if (!mql.matches) {

        scope.stats = STATS;

    } else {

        scope.stats = _.toArray(STATS).slice(0, 3);

    }

};
</code>
</pre>

<p>For a width under 979px only three of the properties are passed to the local scope, while the entire object is used when the width is greater.</p>

<p>I created this as a proof of concept. Savings on page size for handheld devices will be minuscule because the text and HTML is insignificantly small.</p>

<p>The best use case for this is when you can cut the number of service calls from within a controller. Because AngularJS templates degrade gracefully, the HTML created by the service call won’t be rendered; neither will error messages.</p>

<p>It’s possible that this could be used on a number of different sections of the homepage and the difference in initial page download size will be noticeably reduced.</p>

<p>I prefer this approach to any other JavaScript solution because matchMedia, unlike resize of scroll events, fires just the once. The sole aim of doing this is for better performance and this is the most performant solution.</p>

<p>If you are to use matchMedia with service calls then remove the listener once the maximum size has been reached:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
mql.removeListener(handleMediaMatch);
</code>
</pre>

<p>The aim of reducing the initial pagesize has been achieved and from hereon in it’s back to using CSS to hide or display the content.</p>

<p>Even without this it would still be best practice to remove the listener with scope $destroy:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
scope.$on('$destroy', function () {

        mql.removeListener(handleMediaMatch);

});
</code>
</pre>

<p>The downside is that you will now have almost identical code in a number of different controllers and directives. To keep your codebase DRY perhaps it’s possible to use a service as a pub / sub. </p>

<p>I have yet to try this yet but if you do please feel free to share your experiences.</p>

AngularJS and CORs support in Internet Explorer 9

AngularJS

<p>AngularJS is probably the most forward looking framework I have ever used. All other frameworks and Content Management Systems trip over themselves to support legacy browsers. In truth, whether support for PHP4 long after it had been superseded or holding up older versions of Internet Explorer, this has meant restricting the growth of the entire project.</p>

<p>Choosing not to dump this support code and focusing development time on contemporary and future browser support comes at a cost of a slower roadmap.</p>

<p>When the AngularJS team <a href="http://blog.angularjs.org/2013/12/angularjs-13-new-release-approaches.html" rel="external" class="underline">announced last December</a> that version 1.3 would be dropping support for Internet Explorer 8 there was much wailing and nashing of teeth in the comments underneath.</p>

<p>This came from developers in corporate environments who are still being forced to support this obsolete, five-year old browser.</p>

<p>It is true that legacy IE does hang around corporate IT systems like a bad smell longer than anywhere else.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, the AngularJS teams’ decision was entirely correct.</p>

<p>The gap between IE8 and the evergreen browsers on handheld devices is now too large to straddle. To attempt to do so would divert resources away from creating cutting edge software, leading to an unsatisfactory compromise that would affect the pace at which AngularJS needs to grow in order to stay level with hyper-fast technological changes.</p>

<p>However, as things currently stand, I have yet to experience any conflict between AngularJS and Internet Explorer 9. You could quite happily concentrate on developing in Chrome without having to constantly check IE9 for bugs.</p>

<p>But it is likely that the lack of support for Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) will become an issue for your team.</p>

<p>There are a number of solutions, such as the old JSONP hack, but the simplest is using the <a href="https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain" rel="external" class="underline">XDomain</a> third-party library.</p>

<p>XDomain allows you to apply a solution that works without modifying any AngularJS code and, by keeping it in conditional comments, means that it doesn’t affect code running in any browser other than IE9.</p>

<p>To use this polyfill, firstly upload the xdomain.js file to a remote server. You will only need to reference a single version of this.</p>

<p>On the server where the services are held create a HTML file on this path www.example.co.uk/web/IE9/proxy.html, containing the following:</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;script src=" * path to script here * /xdomain.min.js" data-master="*"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>Then, in the HTML of the index.html file add</p>

<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;!--[if IE 9]&gt;
&lt;script src=" * path to script here * /xdomain.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  xdomain.slaves({
    'http://www.example.co.uk': '/web/IE9/proxy.html'
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]-->
</code>
</pre>

<p>Keep adding as many “slaves” as you require.</p>

<p>That’s it. You will now have complete CORs support in IE9.</p>

<p>As a security measure it is recommended to include the X-Frame-Options response header on the remote servers handling your services.</p>

<p>For further information on X-Frame-Options read the following articles:</p>
