<p>My primary responsibility in this project was performance. At the initial usability tests in November 2013, the website was over 3mb in size and took 22 seconds to load on the Tesco Hudle android tablet. By January 2014 the size of the homepage had been reduced to 565kb in size and with load time of under seven seconds on the Hudle, with under 2 seconds the desktop.</p>\
<p>The website is responsive with a heavy emphasis on visual and functionality polarity between the website and the android and iOS apps.</p>",
